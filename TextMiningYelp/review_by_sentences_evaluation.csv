pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,0,1.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,1,Great wanton noodles!
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,2,$3.80 - 4.30 - Warning: the chilli is really spicy!
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,3,so you might wanna stick to just the black bean sauce or may ask them to put less.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,4,- The wanton ares great but the cha sew needs works.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,5,It doesn't taste as fresh and looks a tad but dark.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,6,Dubious color.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,7,2.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,8,Fried wantons $3.80 - So crispy!
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,9,love it.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,10,People order these by the dozens.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,11,It's a really no fuss place.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,12,Kinda like a hawker centre/ food court.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,13,"The sitting area is casual, maybe even a little cramp."
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,14,***NOTE: I found the exact same noodles at Serangoon gardens (not chomp chomp but the other hawker centre.
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,15,there are 2 located there.)
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,16,"Anyways, it serves exactly the same tasting wanton noodles and wantons (I am not sure if they are related) but the prices are much cheaper there since it's not air-conditioned."
pEpYffHCrDpiKf-D5GB_Pw,17,$3 a bowl and $3 a plate of fried wanton.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,0,This is a great location that falls just between the chaos of Vivo City and Sentosa.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,1,This is a new location for Brewerkz that has been placed alongside the veteran wine restaurant next door on the waterside boardwalk.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,2,"On a Saturday night, the crowd was modest."
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,3,The outdoor seating along the waterside offered an impressively relaxed and intimate dining area.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,4,This is a great place to escape the massive crowds that surround either side of the boardwalk.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,5,"On top of that, Brewerkz's food is of higher quality than your typical bar."
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,6,We tried the pizza and salmon salad and both were excellent.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,7,I've also had a great bbq burger in the past.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,8,"Nevertheless, their specialty is drinks, so you can expect a large selection of many varieties, especially custom beers."
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,9,The service was attentive and friendly.
OXs3eP48xFTmo7ZQy0OnCg,10,"I recommend this location after a crowded day at Sentosa or Vivo City, where you can get some rest."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,0,Want a great location for an evening meal?
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,1,You can't go wrong with Brewerkz located in the middle of Sentosa Boardwalk.
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,2,We chanced upon it while walking back to mainland after a day in USS.
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,3,"Despite my headache, I agreed to 'seize the moment' and stayed in to have a few beers and snacks."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,4,"The drinks were the same as you would get in bars anywhere else and not exceptional (about 16 for a beer), though some of them are from their own microbrewery."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,5,The snacks were also unexceptional but definitely satisfactory.
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,6,"The onion rings were $9 for a fairly large basket, and desserts of brownie with ice cream and bread pudding with ice cream were $10 each with equally decent portions."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,7,"The best part is the view, which is really what you're paying for."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,8,The sparkling lights on the floor to mimick the night sky above coupled with the serenity of the sea and the distant twinkling of the cable car lights was a simply divine combination.
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,9,"At 9pm, we were unexpectedly treated to some sort of light show in the distance of a floating platform in front of Sentosa."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,10,"I'm guessing many already know about this but it looks like two birds fighting and ended off with loads of water, light and fireworks."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,11,"From our location, it was perfect, not too loud or crowded, and with the soft backdrop of the bar music."
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,12,We had actually just paid and were about to leave for the bus home but were mesmerised by the fireworks and abstract lights.
sfn5GDgEH5nxzE7V5XerRA,13,"This is a very romantic location to bring a date, or just a laid-back environment to chill with friends."
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,0,Curiosity killed the cat!
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,1,Believe Watami was the restaurant before this and they probably revamped it to Nikku Kappo.
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,2,Thought the raw Sushi concept was interesting so gave it a try.
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,3,Ordered 3 or 4 varienties of raw beef and i can't say they were totally fresh.
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,4,Picture speaks for itsself.
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,5,now the miso beef sukiyai was a big disappointment.
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,6,The beef provided basically were not eatable.
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,7,they were chewy in texture and poor cuts of meat.
T3HDo20BRTqN8ix93nVwwg,8,service was fine but again food taste ia supreme so .....
HGVIAeccMx-idr0DQ-Lq8w,0,The restaurant is quite impressive with its signature yaki tetsu.
HGVIAeccMx-idr0DQ-Lq8w,1,The beef was really tender and tasted great with the sauce.
HGVIAeccMx-idr0DQ-Lq8w,2,"However, I would recommend taking away the side dishes that tend to absorb too much sauce, as too much of it really does not taste good."
KgRX-kYs8YgmNfEIeBH-Zw,0,"The food here is indeed unusual, with many Â innovative dishes rarely found at Japanese restaurants outside Japan."
KgRX-kYs8YgmNfEIeBH-Zw,1,"The meat sushi is interesting, but I still much prefer the seafood variety."
KgRX-kYs8YgmNfEIeBH-Zw,2,"We also had the Yakitetsu Kobe; the meat is tender, and the miso and foie gras sauce is good but overly rich - it's unusual to feel so bloated after a Japanese meal."
KgRX-kYs8YgmNfEIeBH-Zw,3,"Impressive sake and drinks lists; we were offered a complementary sake mojito, which was notoriously poor."
KgRX-kYs8YgmNfEIeBH-Zw,4,"The staff diligently prepare many dishes at the table, but otherwise are a bit forgetful and not pro-active."
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,0,"I'm typically not a fast food fan, but Mos Burger is one that I do go for on occasion."
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,1,"I like the regular ole cheeseburger, which is basically your classic American fast food burger without any frills."
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,2,"In an ever more complex fast food world, it is ironically tough to get this simple classic."
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,3,"I have also tried one of their more strange creations, which consisted of a salmon patty and a bun made out of sticky rice."
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,4,It was quite tasty and didn't seem like eating fast food at all.
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,5,"So, it seems the Japanese have conquered the American automobile and fast food burger."
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,6,What will they take over next?
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,7,P.S.
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,8,I'm pretty sure I was a direct cause of this location now accepting credit cards.
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,9,"One time, I came by without cash, placed an order, and had to run to the ATM and back."
dbEC8f7dFoAJ4b98DXBjNA,10,"The next time I went by, the shop had a brand new PIN machine and were taking cards."
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,0,"This newly-opened Western stall serves a range of barbecued food, usually accompanied by pineapple or white rice (you choose) and some achar (to complement the pineapple rice, I wager)."
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,1,"I decided to give it a try, going for the honey chicken leg that was priced at $4.80 for the smaller set (the larger set has a larger chicken leg at $5.20)."
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,2,The stall also serves Yakitori as well as a fish-and-ebi (prawn) combo meal.
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,3,Most of these items are under $4.
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,4,You can also choose to purchase the items individually without the rice.
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,5,"First up, the chicken: the honey glaze was done nicely, and the chicken was juicy but not too oily."
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,6,"In comparison with the Cold Storage equivalent, however, this is not exactly up to par (though you should consider the price difference of +$3 for the latter)."
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,7,"The pineapple rice definitely needed more flavouring, as it was rather bland and visually not appealing enough."
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,8,"The achar was average and forgettable, while the soup was tasteless."
vKS9q2_AhxyVUB5BFdajJQ,9,"Overall, I think the stall adds some much-needed variety to the hawker centre in this neighbourhood, and families looking for decent Western food that isn't fried (with reused oil) would appreciate the choices provided here."
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,0,Typical prata store in the mornings.
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,1,i had the kosong and the plaster.
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,2,I wanted it with fish curry but it had run out(in the morning??)
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,3,.
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,4,"This prata is very crispy, and not very chewy/ So if you really like it that way, you will enjoy it here."
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,5,The mutton cury was okay.
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,6,but i always preffer the sourish fish curry.
XkkdUMVKMFUM0-p-bvsrwQ,7,They also have thosai which is pretty decent.
bBd6Ofk1zvQaAjGOIaOLtw,0,"In addition to what the name suggests, This place als has fried carrot cake and fried oyster."
bBd6Ofk1zvQaAjGOIaOLtw,1,I have tried both the black and white carrot cakes I have to say that both are pretty good.
bBd6Ofk1zvQaAjGOIaOLtw,2,The black version is fried with a thick sweet sauce and egg.
bBd6Ofk1zvQaAjGOIaOLtw,3,You can taste the chai poh with it and the bits of egg goes very well The White version is savoury the chilli which they fry it with is very good.
apUgG_MV6z0NRVvUVYUgWg,0,"I work in Marsiling , so when I am early, i will get breakfast from one of the nearby coffeeshops and this is one of my regular places."
apUgG_MV6z0NRVvUVYUgWg,1,"This is your typical run of the mill beehoon/nasi lemak/ Fried kuay teow places, where you choose a carb(i usually choose the nasi lemak) and then you pick the dishes you want to go with it."
apUgG_MV6z0NRVvUVYUgWg,2,"fried stuff, like chicken wings, sausages, luncheon meat, fish cakes, ikan billis."
apUgG_MV6z0NRVvUVYUgWg,3,"Then there are some stir fried dishes like long beans, eggplant."
apUgG_MV6z0NRVvUVYUgWg,4,Most times there is a vegetable curry as well.
apUgG_MV6z0NRVvUVYUgWg,5,This place does all pretty well and from the picture you can see its popular too.
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,0,"With Fish and Co., it's best to go old school with Fish and Chips."
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,1,Enjoy a delicious plate of deep fried battered dory fish and hugely cut fries with sauce that you can keep on coming.
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,2,There will be times that we go old school and this is the place with their Fish and Chips.
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,3,"Sometimes, we order a salad to add some leafy balance to the meal."
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,4,"But trust me, a plate of fish and chips is definitely filling with all that protein and carbs."
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,5,I also love how comfortable I am whenever I dine there-enough space for me to enjoy my food without worrying that I'l bump my knee under the table or kick the one in front of me.
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,6,It is priced affordable with a hint of pricey-ness.
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,7,Definitely best enjoyed with family or friends.
TYCovOonDxZLSMx3onJyqQ,8,"Come to think of it, would you rather enjoy that feast all to yourself?"
nWyOCMsufoGVSJVkog82bQ,0,This KFC is at the Zoo's kidzworld.
nWyOCMsufoGVSJVkog82bQ,1,"Although there are ample seating, there is usually no space available even on non-peak period."
nWyOCMsufoGVSJVkog82bQ,2,The tables are occupied by parents waiting for their kids playing at the water play facilities right in front of the restaurant.
nWyOCMsufoGVSJVkog82bQ,3,It might be better to walk outside to the other KFC at the zoo entrance if you are looking for food.
C8n_K1ewaD2MheCTiR-P_g,0,Sad about the price of good beer in Singapore?
C8n_K1ewaD2MheCTiR-P_g,1,"Yeah, you and every other expat in the country."
C8n_K1ewaD2MheCTiR-P_g,2,craftbeer.sg to the rescue.
C8n_K1ewaD2MheCTiR-P_g,3,Sales to the public online only.
C8n_K1ewaD2MheCTiR-P_g,4,Cases (24x330ml) of Chimay red and Duvel delivered in 2-business days for S$160 tax and delivery included.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,0,This is the best place in Singapore to get Gelato for a number of reasons.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,1,1.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,2,The Gelato - tastes AMAZING.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,3,Try the pistachio flavor!
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,4,It is my favorite :) 2.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,5,The location - prime location and perfect for dates or even just to hang out with close friends.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,6,"You can sit and watch people walk by, enjoy music, while eating your gelato and conversing with friends."
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,7,3.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,8,They serve ALCOHOL!!!!
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,9,- They have this awesome champagne that your girlfriend will love.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,10,Get it for her.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,11,They mix the champagne with some strawberry and I think something else.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,12,I can't remember.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,13,Maybe it is their secret recipe?
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,14,lol.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,15,"Anyways, a must try."
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,16,"Also, they have SHOOTERS!"
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,17,I love to come here and drink a bunch of shooters before I go out to a club with my friends.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,18,It is a great way to get the night started.
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,19,4.

zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,23,I urge you to try this place!!
zmHoaMI0GZ01XCxwkXLcAg,24,!
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,0,Great boutique beers at reasonable price.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,1,You can try cold beers there to see if you want more than 1.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,2,Not as nice a drinking space as their other store but great selection and advice.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,3,Great to have this in holland v. Its a little hard to find.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,4,Take the escalators that are on the right side of cold storage to first floor.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,5,"Turn right, then right straight away then another right so you have basically done a u turn."
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,6,Not a very busy mall so there will not be any waiting.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,7,Hopefully this store will survive as it's a great idea.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,8,Check it out.
0w8Fl9kZTdDAChyvD3Kbzw,9,If you love beer and don't want to drink the same thing all the time then this is for you.
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,0,I can't believe I haven't yet dropped Thirsty HV (Holland Village) some Yelp review love?!
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,1,I'm certainly no stranger here as the friendly folks at Thirsty will tell you.
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,2,They're really more like family since I almost live here.
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,3,"Maybe live is a bit of an exaggeration, Â I am to Thirsty HV what Norm was to Cheers."
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,4,That should suggest to you that my review is likely to gloss over a wealth of minor sins in favor of the greater good and how dearly I love this secret jewel of a neighborhood watering hole!
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,5,"This franchise is run by a small crew of knowledgeable, folksy characters who are passionate about beer and just want you to love the stuff as much as they do."
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,6,"This passion runs through not only the staff here but also the regulars, which run the gamut from beer lovers, to connoisseurs and home brewers so be prepared to be given pretty passionate feedback about what you should have or which new bottles you should try."
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,7,If you're lucky you get to sit back relax with a beer while enjoying a lively debate on the relative virtues of different offerings and styles available at Thirsty HV.
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,8,"So it's a bottle shop but you're also allowed to drink on site and more likely than not you'll get offers of a taste of whatever one of the regulars brewed at home, picked up from their travels or is having one out of the chiller."
vC8t15qA93ItmFIXDJd2TQ,9,"While there are Thirsty's all over Singapore, Thirsty's HV is the den of a thoroughly lovable, slightly rowdy, marginally rude family of beer geeks."
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,0,Q Bread is located behind but directly attached to the Aljunied MRT Station.
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,1,This is a small bakery with a nice variety of baked goods.
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,2,There is no seating here so this is strictly grab and go!
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,3,"I picked two items here, a bag of 6 small multi-grain breads and a package of several small dessert croissants."
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,4,"I tried one of the croissants right away, it was light, flaky, and tasted very fresh."
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,5,I tried a bit of the bread later in the day and it was as good as the croissants.
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,6,Everything seemed reasonably priced.
1kaEvkzfTzz46RS1LIyBxA,7,"One word of note, they don't like you taking photos, I took a photo of the outside of the bakery (the one I posted here) and they started waving their hands around saying ""No Photos""."
76IoFl6qlLhMsGdpGDe5rg,0,"This place is a ""spin-off"" from Sprmrkt in McCallum Street and has been open for a few weeks."
76IoFl6qlLhMsGdpGDe5rg,1,It's kinda hidden away in the basement of the Hong Leong Building in an area crowded with lunch alternatives.
76IoFl6qlLhMsGdpGDe5rg,2,"But, don't let the basement ambiance put you off."
76IoFl6qlLhMsGdpGDe5rg,3,"The menu is much more sandwiches, wraps, muffins and cakes - all freshly baked - than Sprmrkt."
76IoFl6qlLhMsGdpGDe5rg,4,"And, they brought the best from their other establishment: creative and great tasting food."
76IoFl6qlLhMsGdpGDe5rg,5,"I don't normally give out five starts after one visit, but this time I'm taking the chance."
76IoFl6qlLhMsGdpGDe5rg,6,I don't think I'll have to go back and change it.
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,0,Black Sesame Carrot Cake Probably one of the only carrot cakes that I actually like other than Cedele's carrot cake.
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,1,"I usually stray away from carrot cakes, because I find them too sweet and ""heaty"" but this cake was very moist with generous servings of nuts, raisins and carrot shreds."
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,2,The White Ombre prides itself in unique cakes and adding the black sesame to this carrot cake was definitely different.
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,3,"However, I think it's more of a decoration as you cannot taste it in the cake."
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,4,"You can clearly taste the dedication and passion the white ombre has to their cakes, as every cake is neatly placed into the cake cabinet and all are uniformly designed."
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,5,All the cakes looked so delicious and fresh.
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,6,Here's the variety of cakes and other sweet treats for sale.
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,7,"Check out the huge baking wonderland, the White Ombre runs baking classes to teach people how to bake cakes, macarons and even more."
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,8,The staff are also very friendly.
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,9,"Take note that the shop has no dining area, all cakes are packed in boxes and ready to take away."
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,10,"Menu of cakes per slice, per whole cake."
0y8CwOxcf1zguqWX_VDyXw,11,Check out the macarons This shop faces a whole stretch of industrial shops.
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,0,The first retail kiosk of Barcook Bakery!
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,1,I love the raisin cream cheese bread here.
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,2,I think there is really no better alternative to this.
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,3,The amount of cream cheese is generous and does not taste too sweet.
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,4,The soft bun goes really well with coffee.
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,5,It tastes best when served warm.
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,6,"You can either heat it up at home, or if you're lucky, you'll probably get your hands on the fresh warm bread!"
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,7,"There was once I got there at about 830pm, and I actually got bread right out of the oven!"
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,8,"I mean, where else can you get freshly baked bread at 830pm?!"
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,9,I would also recommend the cranberry and raisin loaf.
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,10,"I like the combination of cranberry and raisin; the bread tastes good on its own, you won't even need a spread."
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,11,"However, since this is only a kiosk, it does not sell cakes."
yg7HUPZFKkRKJfdmoU-h8g,12,"Other than that, it's as good as it can get!"
sgGYbMwD83o0-AFfMXVFEQ,0,Enjoyed their hazelnut and custard sponge cakes.
sgGYbMwD83o0-AFfMXVFEQ,1,"They come individually packed, like a muffin, and make a great afternoon snack or desert after lunch."
sgGYbMwD83o0-AFfMXVFEQ,2,"The sponge is light and fluffy, and not too sweet - the first time I had it it was still warm which was heavenly :) Very reasonably priced with lots of other sponge cakes and varieties available."
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,0,"Before the rise of bespoke cocktails bars such as 28 Hong Kong Street , there was Drink Culture, a cool white washed club like bar that caters to the slightly older and sophisticated crowd."
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,1,It looks very discrete even though it's located at the corner of the road.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,2,The great thing is the ambiance and clients of course.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,3,There is absolutely no worries of being harassed by drunken young punks.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,4,It's just people wanting to sit back and nurse a delicious cocktail with friends.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,5,"If you have no idea what to order, simply tell the bartender what mood you are in or what flavors you want to have in your drinks."
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,6,He'll cook up something for you.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,7,"Fresh ingredients are used here and if you sit at the bar, you can see the guys at work."
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,8,I didn't see any syrup being used at all to flavor the drinks.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,9,Did i also mention that the alcohol content is very high?
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,10,Heh.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,11,What's good here: Cosmo.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,12,The Choco FlambÃ© Martini drinks like a dessert.
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,13,"The top coating of milk foam is gently blow-torched until it caramelizes into a light, fluffy texture but the drink is left untouched."
7LFjHQxXVUhKvpGA6e3cIA,14,I even had a smiley face on mine.

MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,0,"Right after eating my dinner, I was looking for a dessert to satisfy my sweet tooth."
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,1,"In my search, I found a shop called 'Berrylite Frozen Yogurt' that offered 100% fat free cold dessert."
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,2,It looks just like an ice-cream parlour.
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,3,"Instead of ice-cream tubs on display ready to be scooped up upon a cone or cup, rows of multi-coloured toppings such as fruits, nuts, and cereals were provided."
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,4,"Behind the staff, is a yogurt dispensing machine for him to serve the dessert."
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,5,I ordered one topped with fruits like strawberries and peaches filled in a cup.
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,6,"Once readied, I ate a mouthful of the dessert and was shaken up with cool fruity flavour mixed with chilly yoghurt goodness."
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,7,The mixture of yoghurt and fruits swirling in my mouth complemented each other well as the taste exploded with rich flavour.
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,8,I became oblivious to the overwhelming experience that overcame me till the staff took notice and smiled.
MBumE-LNr0GJsGzfXkPEdA,9,We both knew I enjoyed the dessert incredibly.Berrylite Frozen Yogurt's opening hours: 11am - 10pm.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,0,Spotted a few stalls offering steamed fish head Â last week.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,1,"Returned with hubby to try the fish head on a Sunday but unfortunately, the stall (which seemed to offer more steamed fish head options) two doors away was closed."
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,2,So we tried this stall.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,3,The wait was 50mins.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,4,We had their signature fishhead Â & Â fried huang ti vegetable.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,5,The latter was well executed.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,6,The signature fishhead was OK but nothing to shout about.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,7,The fish used was a river-fish and the chilli spices did not manage to mask the muddiness.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,8,There was also too much bones for a fishhead.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,9,Was inspired to try the steamed fish head after eating an awesome steamed fish head at Chinatown a few months back.
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,10,"By the way, steamed fish head is full of collagen."
jBMu9dqDNlvAcO8KQJbm2w,11,I'd come back here to try other dishes which are all reasonably priced.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,0,Hock Heng You Tiao ç¦å´æ²¹æ¡ is a stall located at Tanglin Halt Food Centre specialising in deep fried dough fritters.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,1,This stall is located two units away from No.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,2,1 Western Food é©°åè¥¿é¤.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,3,The Hungry Bunny recommended this stall since I was at Tanglin Halt Food Centre.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,4,"Hock Heng You Tiao sells a variety of deep fried dough fritters such as You Tiao, Salted Hum Chim Peng (Hum Jin Peng), Butterfly Bun and Lotus Paste Hum Chim Peng."
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,5,Everything at Hock Heng You Tiao are freshly made!
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,6,"You may have noticed from the photos above, the owner was kneading, rolling and folding the dough preparing the next batch of Hum Chim Peng and You Tiao."
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,7,"After which, his daughter would help to deep fry them."
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,8,The owner's wife also helps out at the stall.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,9,Each item at the stall costs only $0.70.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,10,Savory (Salted) Hum Chim Peng $0.70 I bought a Savory (Salted) Hum Chim Peng $0.70 to try out when I was there.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,11,I must admit that it sure was good.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,12,"The Hum Chim Peng was soft, chewy and fluffy."
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,13,I especially love it when I reach the part which was savoury.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,14,"Having tried this out, I decided to purchase some home."
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,15,The Butterfly Bun $0.70 was fried with sesame seeds which gave it an extra fragrant.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,16,It is similar to You Tiao except for the fact that it had a different shape and was sweeter in taste.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,17,"Anyway, my advice would be to have these deep fried dough fritters on the spot after buying."
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,18,It is best eaten when it is freshly fried.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,19,Those that I bought home and ate the next morning became a tad too tough on the outside.
LDLXBmLHeHF0EM-OhhdWJQ,20,"Nevertheless, Hock Heng You Tiao is worth a try."

x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,0,"Chomp Chomp Food Centre (Hawker Centre) is located at located at Kensington Park Road, Serangoon Gardens."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,1,The nearest MRT station is Serangoon and you would need to take a 10-15 minutes bus ride to reach this Food Centre.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,2,The structure of Chomp Chomp is narrow with little walking space.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,3,"In terms of ventilation, it is pretty bad."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,4,"The low roof which keeps the smoke from the various barbecue stalls in, leads to a warm environment."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,5,You are bound to smell and work up a sweat when eating at this food centre.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,6,"Unlike other Hawker Centre, Chomp Chomp is relatively small with just 36 stalls and limited seating capacity."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,7,It a challenge getting seats especially if you are with a big group.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,8,"In the day time, most stalls are closed in Chomp Chomp."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,9,It springs to life only in the evening (5pm) when the stalls start opening for business and customers start flocking in.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,10,"Despite these shortcomings, Singaporeans like myself love this place."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,11,It is a food paradise with a wide variety of affordable local delicacies!
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,12,"I visited Chomp Chomp on a Thursday night at 730pm thinking that since it was a weekday, there would not be many people."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,13,"Well, I was wrong."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,14,Chomp Chomp was packed with people!
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,15,It was difficult getting a table for four person.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,16,"We had to strategically position ourselves (like vultures) at certain tables, hoping to 'secure' a table."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,17,"It was nearly 20 minutes later, before we got a table for four."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,18,Do remember to take note of your table number.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,19,This is because you would need this number when ordering as all the food (including drinks such as sugar cane) would be served to you at your table.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,20,"As for payment, some stalls would collect payment upon order while some stalls would collect payment only upon serving the food at your table."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,21,"Some customers maybe concerned about this, but I have never encountered any instances where by the food was not served after payment."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,22,There were at least three barbecue (BBQ) Chicken Wing stalls at Chomp Chomp Food Centre.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,23,We ordered ours from Daily Fresh BBQ Chicken Wings å¤é²ç§ç¤é¸¡ç¿è which was located next to Chomp Chomp Hai Wei Yuan Seafood BBQ å¿ å¿ æµ·å³å­BBQæµ·é²ç§ç¤.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,24,Each piece of BBQ Chicken Wing from Daily Fresh BBQ Chicken Wings cost $1.20.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,25,"In fact, all the BBQ Chicken Wing stalls in Chomp Chomp sell their chicken wings at the same price."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,26,The BBQ Chicken Wings from Daily Fresh BBQ Chicken Wings were tender and succulent.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,27,I love the charred parts especially those near the tail end of the wings.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,28,"Like most people, I preferred to squeeze the lime over the chicken wings to give them an extra zest."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,29,"Having said that, I am of the opinion that the BBQ Chicken Wings were good, but not fantastic."
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,30,The natural flavour was not brought out and it lacked the fragrant aroma which is the hallmark of a well-executed piece of BBQ Chicken Wing.
x1d4mNHW62TUcnK4bRaCSw,31,"The chilli sauce provided was quite good and played the perfect role as a dipping sauce, enhancing the overall taste up a notch."

0lF6VGUq_cQMj9kwlpXO2w,0,Terrible service the pics are deceitful and the shakes were horrible!
0lF6VGUq_cQMj9kwlpXO2w,1,Please don't go there
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,0,I should preface this brief review by stating categorically that I'm on firmer ground with Â Scotch Whiskeys and beer.
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,1,"I just never got round to wine, Â I guess, and on the few occasions where it was necessary socially to cross paths with vino, it was always uncomfortable, hoity-toity and inaccessible."
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,2,Which is why I appreciate the guys at Wine Culture being super patient with me and never hard selling me on anything.
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,3,"I've read tips that other Yelpers have had bad experiences here and I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm guessing that might have been at the ""old"" Wine Culture (see pic labeled ""Wine Cult?"")."
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,4,I have to admit that I've only ever stepped in here after they renovated and expanded.
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,5,Kenny has always been more than happy to share what he knows about their inventory and always glad to offer helpful suggestions based on what you're likely to need wine for.
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,6,I usually appreciate service providers who have good product knowledge and are happy to put that knowledge at your disposal.
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,7,I also like the fact that every visit for me is edifying.
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,8,Who says education costs money?
H2AVjMiifS_LrwYTLFx4yg,9,?
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,0,Ah one of my favorite duck rice places.
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,1,"They sell braised duck only, but what I like is the whole set."
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,2,"From the rice, to the duck to the sauce."
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,3,The rice is really really well done.
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,4,"While it does not come across as strong tasting, it is fragrant for me."
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,5,It contains peanuts inside as well!
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,6,"Besides that, the lean duck meat that they serve is really very tender and soft."
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,7,I absolutely love it and I feel that this place is one of the more unknown places that Singaporean foodies usually would have missed out when going on a food trail.
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,8,"To top it off, their sauce is superb!"
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,9,I like it as it is not too sweet and it is fragrant.
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,10,The whole plate comes together very nicely and at an affordable price $3.50.
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,11,The stall is operated by an old couple so do expect that the stall have slightly slower service.
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,12,But be patient!
4BWRD_WV9gBdVjrfFCXRqQ,13,Your patience will be rewarded with an excellent plate of duck rice.
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,0,Another good chicken rice place in Singapore with a long queue during meal hours.
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,1,Singapore just doesn't seem to run out of nice chicken rice places doesn't it?
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,2,"Well, Seng Bee's stall is more popular for their Lemon Chicken RIce though."
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,3,The lemon sauce is sweet and the fried chicken is crispy enough to accompany the soft rice.
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,4,"The price is also not that expensive as well, coming in at only $3.50 for a plate."
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,5,"However, when I'm with friends, we would order half a chicken at $11 and several portions of rice."
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,6,One thing to add is their crispy tofu which is really well done as well.
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,7,It's nearly a staple for my friends and I when we eat at Seng Bee.
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,8,"Don't worry about the long queue, their service is really quite fast and the food will reach you within 10 minutes of ordering."
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,9,One thing that my friends have told me about is that their curry chicken noodles are very good as well.
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,10,I have not hat the chance to taste it because I really prefer their lemon chicken rice.
8w_kRfl-6aD7cNjHpqVTVQ,11,"For those who read it and prefer curry chicken, do try it out and leave a note if it's as good as my friends say!"
LsuFrpm-ESlFEgfc80noww,0,"We had our lunch here, was impressed by the staff who were attending to us."
LsuFrpm-ESlFEgfc80noww,1,We ordered the lunch special - pasta with stew beef which was well done n tasty.
LsuFrpm-ESlFEgfc80noww,2,The truffle mushroom fries were delicious although it wasn't impressive looking when it arrived on our table.
LsuFrpm-ESlFEgfc80noww,3,The price of the special lunch set was reasonable n affordable!
LsuFrpm-ESlFEgfc80noww,4,We will be back for ore :)
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,0,"In the mass of satay stalls in this food centre, Teddy Bear stood out because it serves Chinese style satays - which means you get pork satays."
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,1,My personal favorite satay has always been chicken and I tend to like the Chinese style better as chunky pieces of meat is used rather than minced meat.
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,2,Teddy bear does it this way too.
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,3,They also serves up a good BBQ chicken wings.
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,4,"Lean and succulent, nicely marinated."
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,5,The wings are not overly fatty so you can still eat up the crispy skin guilt-free (or as much as you'd like to believe).
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,6,They only open for lunch on weekends and public holidays.
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,7,"In the evenings, they also have the tendency to run out by 8.30pm."
WhLk8NVFWVEDiyC8DQN8Mg,8,So get there early to avoid disappointment.
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,0,Good value good taste.
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,1,One of those stalls that provide good food at good price points typical of good hawker type foods.
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,2,"Probably good enough for repeat customers, unlikely to become hawker legends."
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,3,The ingredients for a typical Kueh Chap is intestines!
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,4,"But, I don't see intestines."
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,5,"I see and ate tongue, pork belly, egg, skin, dao-pok (dried and fried soyabean squares), small side of green marinated vegetables (there's probably a name for it, I just don't know what) The taste is acceptable, but unmemorable."
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,6,The kueh chap (the flat square noodles) that comes with the order taste exceptionally good.
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,7,"It retains its texture, shape, cooked just right."
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,8,"It is soaked in the same brown sauce but diluted enough, not too salty, but still gives it flavor."
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,9,The chilli is good enough; vingearish and spicy enough.
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,10,Also quite common and forgetably average.
yVtFzMWsKgNc50IEyGkBjg,11,"If you are not interested in Q-ing for food here, this stall can satisfy."
QklEI7Hsac6pCgGdOSIp7w,0,Fish soup with Bittergourd slices.
QklEI7Hsac6pCgGdOSIp7w,1,Another decent fish soup noodles or rice place at decent prices.
QklEI7Hsac6pCgGdOSIp7w,2,"Anything good enough to generate a Q during lunch hour, is quite a safe bet."
QklEI7Hsac6pCgGdOSIp7w,3,Fresh fish slices.
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,0,"Nice, comfort food."
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,1,"I had a quick lunch here today, pleasantly surprised to discover the chinatown point branch, after having eaten at sunshine plaza a few times."
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,2,"I had the liu sha bao, which was warm, gooey, sweet and salty at the same time."
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,3,Only point for improvement is the bun itself; it was not as soft and fine as the best buns should be.
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,4,"On the side, I had fried prawn rolls."
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,5,"Crispy, with a dipping sauce that cuts the oiliness and brings out the umami."
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,6,Service was fast and efficient.
wmlp_34a8zxmuCMgfiiODw,7,"No fancy ambience, just focus on the food."
O73-VIbA-7E8DQOJ8WGnuA,0,"Speedy service, busy atmosphere, fast food of subpar taste, rowdy children running amok, just like any other Mac Donald's outlet."
O73-VIbA-7E8DQOJ8WGnuA,1,Love the close proximity to junction 8 and the surrounding HDB blocks...truly a good excuse to have a cheat day
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,0,In recent times I have been disappointed again and again after visiting a newly opened Japanese restaurant.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,1,First it was Hajime in Atlanta which I had happily served them a 1 star rating and now Kotobuki Izakaya a 2 stars.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,2,At least Kotobuki has friendly staffs and to go boxes!!
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,3,My sis wanted to take me out for lunch and suggested this newly opened Japanese restaurant yesterday.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,4,The restaurant clearly looked like new.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,5,The decor and ambience definitely looks authentic and amazing as well.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,6,What so not amazing was the Tonkotsu ramen.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,7,There is nothing Tonkotsu in my ramen.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,8,Tonkotsu ramen's broth main ingredient is pork bone.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,9,There is no sight of the rich white pork based style broth here.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,10,The gyozas are alright and my sister complained her coffee tasted sour.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,11,I just read the the restaurant's culinary team Master Chef originally hailed from Fukuoka.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,12,He should know better than many about Tonkotsu since it is commonly used in Hakata style ramen common in Hakata district in the city of Fukuoka.
kRrw8O2idKj44veUCzRx_g,13,2 stars here from me is simply to give this restaurant a chance since it is so new and for the friendly staffs.
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,0,"There's a reason they added an ""Xtra"" at the back of the name: this place is huge!"
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,1,"I think it takes up more than half of all available floor space in AMK Hub's basement, and houses virtually everything you can imagine a supermarket would carry."
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,2,"But you can't possibly cram everything under one roof, so for things like electronics and furniture I still prefer to go to more specialised brands as the selection here is quite small."
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,3,"And forget about buying clothes and shoes here, there's nothing good of that sort."
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,4,"The fresh and frozen food section, on the other hand, is just marvellously comprehensive."
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,5,"I'm not much of a chef, but I've always been able to find everything I need there."
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,6,"Some of the cooked food are also great in a pinch, like the sushi."
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,7,The alcohol section is also pretty good.
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,8,"They've recently added some self-checkout machines, but I don't think it has served it's intended goal of speeding up crowd dispersal."
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,9,Many people still stand confused in front of the machines.
ttMSBzlPnzAKv1FB4CHcCg,10,"Maybe it'll be better off in the long term, but for now try to avoid the evening peak period if you can."
4IXtoc6swKa7W_j4CyO_PQ,0,Good if you are looking for cheaper prices and all Asian stuff.
4IXtoc6swKa7W_j4CyO_PQ,1,But my informants told me that not all items are always cheaper than NTUC.
4IXtoc6swKa7W_j4CyO_PQ,2,Some are a little more.
4IXtoc6swKa7W_j4CyO_PQ,3,Perfect for the older generation as most of the cashiers/staff speaks mandarin.
4IXtoc6swKa7W_j4CyO_PQ,4,The cashiers are also really helpful as they sometimes help carry the bags to the cars when the store is not too busy.
4IXtoc6swKa7W_j4CyO_PQ,5,One star for that!
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,0,"Also a wine shop with a wide variety of wines, Miss U CafÃ© serves Western cuisine at affordable prices."
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,1,It is a quiet and dimly lit cafÃ© with tealight candles that is suitable for dates or gatherings.
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,2,"The ambience is cozy, immediately making one feel at home."
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,3,"They even have couches at the back of the cafÃ©, for customers who prefer to have a more laidback meal or wish to lounge."
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,4,The chicken wings at Miss U CafÃ© are to die for!
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,5,Each wing was fried till crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,6,Every bite into the chicken wings created an explosion of flavor in my mouth; it was just that good.
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,7,"Other dishes that are recommended and raved about include their Fried Calamari, Ham and Mushroom Pizza, Salmon Hollandaise and Lamp Chops."
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,8,"Miss U CafÃ© also serves New Zealand All Natural ice cream, with an ice cream cooler with all the flavors on display at the counter."
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,9,Your dessert orders of the Brownie or Crepes would come with the ice cream of your choice.
B8J0BNBW_6oFOi3hsoVEuw,10,"With exemplary service, and warm and attentive staff, I really cannot find anything wrong with this place."
9QnpJ_5CarlzCPyS5SDOUA,0,The McCafÃ© at Tampines Mall deserves some honorable mention!
9QnpJ_5CarlzCPyS5SDOUA,1,It has one of the most relaxing and chill environment a McCafÃ© can get.
9QnpJ_5CarlzCPyS5SDOUA,2,"For this outlet, the McDonald's side and the McCafÃ© is separated, which gives a sense of exclusivity as you enjoy a good cup of coffee."
9QnpJ_5CarlzCPyS5SDOUA,3,"Service wise, it's thumbs up!"
9QnpJ_5CarlzCPyS5SDOUA,4,"Even if you order just a simple cup of flat white, the barista will at least bother to do a little latte art for you (this service is not consistently seen at other McCafÃ© outlets)."
9QnpJ_5CarlzCPyS5SDOUA,5,"On the downside, this is not a 24 hour outlet and it can be crowded on weekends and Friday evenings."
9QnpJ_5CarlzCPyS5SDOUA,6,"Other than that, thumbs up for the superb service!"
-soDqKUaTRMB06D_Eqmu3w,0,I love to frequent McCafe for their MELTS.
-soDqKUaTRMB06D_Eqmu3w,1,"Chocolate Melts, Cinnamon Melts.. ohhh so sinful."
-soDqKUaTRMB06D_Eqmu3w,2,"It's not only cheap and affordable, the people here are nice."
-soDqKUaTRMB06D_Eqmu3w,3,I love their iced tea and their mango smoothie as well.
-soDqKUaTRMB06D_Eqmu3w,4,If you are looking for a good place to cram at McCafe here will be a good place.
-soDqKUaTRMB06D_Eqmu3w,5,"On the downside for me, this place is sadly a little far..."
n8HIp1dZyMYMkFthDgNDyA,0,NOT MY FIRST TIME HERE PRICE: OKAY I bought cheese fries at $4 but overall the menu price is quite standard like any other fast food restaurant but the snacker boxes are always value for money!
n8HIp1dZyMYMkFthDgNDyA,1,FOOD: AWESOME My cheese fries today were really good.
n8HIp1dZyMYMkFthDgNDyA,2,They were real hot even after waiting for about 10 min before i ate!
n8HIp1dZyMYMkFthDgNDyA,3,"The cheese was also nice and warm which is really good, the cheese is not always hot so really good today!"
n8HIp1dZyMYMkFthDgNDyA,4,Serving was a little small like it was not completely filled only about 4/5 of the way but its still okay for me.
n8HIp1dZyMYMkFthDgNDyA,5,OVERALL: GOOD just a small snack review today but hope I'll be going there again soon to have a meal and write more reviews!
GFa-mVELBBiBAt93Um_NBA,0,I found a hair!
GFa-mVELBBiBAt93Um_NBA,1,":( I want to like this place, but the hair and the odd pesto really makes it lose some points."
GFa-mVELBBiBAt93Um_NBA,2,I was happy another place opened but sadly it doesn't quite cut it...
GFa-mVELBBiBAt93Um_NBA,3,Yet.
GFa-mVELBBiBAt93Um_NBA,4,"It's small which means there is a longer line, but that is ok is you expect it, what is not though is seeing the same scoop being used for several toppings and the need to request sauce on the side instead of it being standard."
GFa-mVELBBiBAt93Um_NBA,5,"I was disappointed and I may try it again, however I'm still a fan of omnivore."
GFa-mVELBBiBAt93Um_NBA,6,"More expensive, but much bigger portions and better quality ingredients."
Pq_gIUEfbNIxaBknW2Idjg,0,Its the happiest place since childhood.
Pq_gIUEfbNIxaBknW2Idjg,1,"Airport + McDonald Double Cheese Burger, the perfect combinations."
Pq_gIUEfbNIxaBknW2Idjg,2,Carries so much memories!!
Pq_gIUEfbNIxaBknW2Idjg,3,"The definite stop over place arriving or departing Changi, never missed once :-)"
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,0,"Da Dong and I go way back, to even before I was born."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,1,"This is the place that my great grandfather used to bring his granddaughter, i.e."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,2,my mum for dim sum when she was a kid.
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,3,"So yeah, this place and I, we be homies yo."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,4,"It's since been acquired by the Fatty Weng group, which usually spells disaster for food quality."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,5,"However, I was pleasantly surprised that the dim sum is still decent, and in my opinion, better than the likes of a drink tea establishment located just opposite."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,6,"We swung by on a Tuesday afternoon, looking for lunch."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,7,"Strangely enough, we were the only table of locals, and the other customers were all foreigners milling about Chinatown, ordering dishes of chilli crab and jugs of beer."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,8,"*coughtouristscough* Our orders: Big bao, har gao, fried carrot cake, fried bean curd skin and shrimp chee cheong fun."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,9,"Big bao was so big, it had to be cut into quarters."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,10,"Fluffy bread, soft juicy chunks of chicken and an inch of chinese sausage graced the interior."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,11,"The chee cheong fun was silky and came tightly packed in a roll, rather than the limp flat thing that I'm used to outside."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,12,"Fried carrot cake was a smooshy goodness in a crisp fried exterior, and I gladly burnt my tongue in haste to stuff it into my eat hole."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,13,"The har gao was of generous proportion, but a bit of a miss as the skin got dry and hard when left aside for too long."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,14,"Fried bean curd skin was good, though the most ho hum of the lot."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,15,"I haven't been here in ages, but am impressed that the standard hasn't dropped at all, and that everything seems to be made from scratch."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,16,"The bill cometh, and for five items, it set us back $22.85 - rather affordable in comparison to the likes of the drink tea establishment nearby."
om2LgcTd134hcdJmtK3vNA,17,Need to return to Da Dong as soon as I can round up more dim sum kakis.
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,0,"A Gem of a Find Ever since the gf and family moved to Cantonment, finding good, reasonably cheap food has been a bit of a challenge."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,1,"Not that there aren't good food around, just that with Maxwell and Chinatown about a 10-15 mins walk away, there are those days that you don't really feel like walking that far."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,2,"And when it comes to breakfast, the options get even slimmer, with most of the f&b outlets around the area being either higher end restaurants, hipster cafÃ©s or Korean restaurants (14 Korean outlets along Tanjong Pagar Rd)."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,3,So it was a great relief to us when we discovered Guangdong Porridge.
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,4,It isn't the first time we've seen this place but we never had the chance to try it till recently.
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,5,"Tucked away in a small coffee shop (with quite frankly a pretty hipster name, Henly Huat Drink Food Court) is Guangdong porridge."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,6,"Located at the junction of Keong Saik Street and Neil Rd, the coffee shop is one of those places you'll never really take notice off, especially when driving."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,7,"No bright fancy lights, no huge crowds (essentially because there aren't that many seats to begin with), this little coffeeshop certainly has it's faithful followers (I've seen, who I would assume as one of Luxe Singapore's bosses, buying porridge 2 out of the 3 times I've been here)."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,8,They have around 4 stalls here (I think).
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,9,"Yong Tau Foo, Fishball noodle (which looks pretty popular as well), I believe a Tze Char and of course, Guangdong Porridge."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,10,"I'll make it clear though, if you're a fan of the super smooth, Crystal Jade style of porridge, than this may or may not be your cup of tea."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,11,"While it's still a smooth bowl of porridge, it is definitely a more coffee shop, wholesome, heart warming, comfort food style porridge."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,12,"Century Egg and Lean meat porridge ($3.50) A staple of any porridge store, the century egg and lean meat porridge is fantastic."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,13,It comes with a generous amount of century eggs that compliments the porridge perfectly.
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,14,Mixed Pork porridge ($5.00) Now this has to be one of their signature dishes.
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,15,"Ingredients wise, very generous!"
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,16,"3 meat balls (which were so tender and juicy), lean meat, liver and intestines."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,17,"And best of all, none of these items were over cooked!"
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,18,"Everything was well balanced, well poached and added so much flavour into the porridge."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,19,"Only drawback would be that the lean meat is a bit tough and if you're not a fan of bloody liver, you might want them to cook it a little longer for you."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,20,"I'm very particular with my coffee shop porridges, from the claypot style frog leg porridges to these little one bowl wonders and nothing makes me happier than saying that Guangdong Porridge hits all the right spots."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,21,"To me, the key to Guangdong porridge is to not over complicate the dish, at the same time, ensuring that all the ingredients that go into the porridge are cooked absolutely perfect."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,22,"Be warned though, the lady taking the orders can be a little fierce, especially when you're undecided, but with the prices they're offering and the quality of food they're serving, I suppose they can afford to be that little bit fierce."
wgKk__pNcF1lir6f8flRyA,23,I'm already drooling writing this and I can't wait for this weekend's dosage.
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,0,"Consistent quality, value for money, great taste!"
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,1,This is another one of those local food made good which has multiple outlets now.
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,2,"I always like it's lor mee, and now my favorite here is the fried fish lor mee."
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,3,"The soup base is consistent with the other stalls, and the fried fish version $4 is my favorite for now."
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,4,"The original version is only $2.50, and who sells at this price now?"
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,5,"Remember to add a table spoon of chilli, and a table spoon of garlic, and a few squeeze of vingear."
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,6,This will create a memorable event each time you eat here.
qtpzHTa0JQvankJQVw78tg,7,No need photos to recall.
wvsHFnCYlG3cnrxlWB7TWQ,0,"From cold crabs, pork trotter jelly to yam-pumpkin and ginkgo nut paste, Lee Kui is the place to go to for authentic Teochew cuisine."
wvsHFnCYlG3cnrxlWB7TWQ,1,"Established in 1968, it is still a popular place for birthday dinners."
wvsHFnCYlG3cnrxlWB7TWQ,2,The decor may be old school but the diners are here for the food than its ambience.
wvsHFnCYlG3cnrxlWB7TWQ,3,"Sadly, Lee Kui will be closing its doors in mid-December."
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,0,It's summer!
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,1,And then you stumble upon an ice-cream parlour.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,2,A Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlour!
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,3,"Step right in, you will see two large ice-cream freezer displays with all the various flavours."
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,4,I was spoilt for choices.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,5,I have always been a fan of Ben & Jerry's ice cream ever since I was a kid.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,6,But eating those frozen desserts freshly scooped from it's parlour is something else.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,7,"Besides, they always have some special flavours which are not sold in those pints at your everyday supermarkets."
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,8,The place is one of the spacious B&J outlets I've been to.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,9,It's great that they also have cold water dispenser.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,10,"I bought the ""Mix & Match"" combo, a choice of 3 scoops, served in a waffle bowl."
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,11,You should not NOT take advantage of those toppings available.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,12,I chose peanuts and those colourful 100-thousands.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,13,A real-deal of perfect sugar rush.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,14,My companion bought a brownie that is served with 2-scoops.
A5Lb-Pr5TFDxOTSOyIPZYg,15,"Both of us chose the Cookie Dough flavour as one of our scoops, and gosh was it delish!"
0Q1Nv-QaGK6Sz_LYSEXzTA,0,Been coming here for years and my fav was the goldrush.
0Q1Nv-QaGK6Sz_LYSEXzTA,1,Got a shock today for a change of flavor they charge $1 for that???
0Q1Nv-QaGK6Sz_LYSEXzTA,2,What's up with that?
0Q1Nv-QaGK6Sz_LYSEXzTA,3,Not asking for one more scoop or was it too much work to remember the change??
0Q1Nv-QaGK6Sz_LYSEXzTA,4,For this.....a bad star for you Swensen.
0Q1Nv-QaGK6Sz_LYSEXzTA,5,Also there seems to be a change in staff as everything seems a little slower.
1XGMF5mZl0JazfgmUJen7w,0,Ice cream = yum!
1XGMF5mZl0JazfgmUJen7w,1,I like Udders for its range of flavours (most places have one durian flavour--Udders has THREE) but mostly for its proximity to my house.
1XGMF5mZl0JazfgmUJen7w,2,"It's become a very convenient and welcome place for meetups with friends because hey, everyone likes ice cream, and it keeps the children entertained."
1XGMF5mZl0JazfgmUJen7w,3,"They're famous for their liquor flavours, though they're not really my thing; I find that sometimes the strength of the alcohol overwhelms the flavours, and sometimes the ice creams turn out icey rather than smooth."
1XGMF5mZl0JazfgmUJen7w,4,"But hey, everyone needs lemoncello sorbert and the sugary overload of snickers-mars-honeycomb once in a while!"
1XGMF5mZl0JazfgmUJen7w,5,Also: watch out for new flavours and ask the staff about them--sometimes they're testing new flavours and will give you a scoop to sample!
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,0,"It has been years since I visited this store and now, they expanded another section where they serve all day breakfast dishes, pancakes, mille crepes, and more."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,1,"Prior to visiting this store, I ate quite a bit for dinner."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,2,My friend called me out of nowhere and asked me whether I would like to join her and her boyfriend here.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,3,"As this place is pretty close in terms of proximity, I said yes without much hesitation."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,4,"As this store is located at a street, you could either parallel park your vehicle or head to the public carpark to park the car."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,5,You would need parking coupons here till 10pm.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,6,"After 10pm, parking is free."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,7,Walked into the store and I realized there is two sections for ice cream.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,8,One with alcoholic related flavors and one without.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,9,"And on top of the ice cream display, you can find sundae menus."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,10,"Before deciding the flavor I would like to have, I browsed through the sundae menu and hence I ordered a scoop of Alphonso Mango."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,11,It is more like a sorbet gelato than an ice cream.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,12,My friends ordered three scoops of ice-cream with waffle.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,13,"As I was extremely full, I just took a picture of their food instead of trying out the waffle."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,14,"Space wise, it definitely had expanded."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,15,The newer section had interesting fire extinguisher boxes which had different sayings on it.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,16,Some tables had also shadow boxes that they use to contain stuff animals.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,17,It does looks like a cafe after they extend the shopfront.
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,18,"Since I didn't pay for my single scoop, I can't comment much on the price."
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,19,But I definitely like the interior design of the newer section of the store especially at the entrance door made of glass and pieces of broken glass inside the multi-layered glass door (forgot to take a picture of it).
p0G3ANp9J-EGhc9waJ9hlg,20,Will try their other foods or desserts the next time round.

mnTvSJko6TOABgKZXmKu3w,0,$1.50 for ice cream???
mnTvSJko6TOABgKZXmKu3w,1,Hell to the no!
mnTvSJko6TOABgKZXmKu3w,2,Walk about 15 steps towards the Central and you'll find an Uncle selling it for $1.00--the proper Singaporean price for a slice of ice cream.
naiw1gPMGqgsjBVq_1YFMQ,0,As we wondered around Clark Quay we found this gentlemen selling ice cream.
naiw1gPMGqgsjBVq_1YFMQ,1,I purchased a cookies and cream and we sat on the bridge watching the night scene.
naiw1gPMGqgsjBVq_1YFMQ,2,One for the budget traveller!
naiw1gPMGqgsjBVq_1YFMQ,3,For $1.50 you receive a slab for ice cream and two biscuits sandwiched on top to make a ice cream sandwich.
naiw1gPMGqgsjBVq_1YFMQ,4,One of my favourite moments in Singapore
MfRliEJUQ7pFrSUeUfSTYA,0,Decent food decent price.
MfRliEJUQ7pFrSUeUfSTYA,1,No Hawker Legend.
MfRliEJUQ7pFrSUeUfSTYA,2,"Not in the mood for Q today, settling for safe and comfort food."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,0,"No Mood for Spring After This Cuisine Yechun Express, a newly opened Chinese restaurant in Chinatown Point, was opened to celebrate Yangzhou's 2,500 year heritage, showcasing the best of Yangzhou Cuisine."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,1,"The name Yechun, apparently means to cultivate the mood for spring."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,2,"Unfortunately, the only mood this restaurant cultivated for us was disappointment."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,3,The restaurant looked decent enough.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,4,"Tea house style setting, nothing overly fancy, but where it fails terribly is in its service and most importantly, it's food."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,5,"Because it's a newly opened establishment, I'll give the service some leeway, since every restaurant has its teething problems but the food, the food is one thing I can't forgive."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,6,Salted Duck Soup.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,7,One word.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,8,Disgusted.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,9,"While it wasn't the worst tasting soup we've ever tasted, it certainly offered the biggest let down."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,10,"Served to us in a steaming bowl, we were initially pretty excited, however, once the lid came off, we thought we were pranked!"
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,11,"Inside the bowl lay 3 wolfberries, a couple of preserved vegetable and 3 miserable...."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,12,"MISERABLE pieces of duck, which looked more like spare parts you take off the chopping board and threw it in for the sake of it."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,13,"While I can understand that the rent may be high and this is a way of saving cost, it's ridiculous to be paying nearly $10.00 for and duck soup when there's barely any duck in it."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,14,"In fact, it was almost an insult to be served it."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,15,"A quick check with the staff taking orders if this is the way it's normally served and the only response was ""yes it's like that""."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,16,The taste?
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,17,"3 words, MSG."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,18,There wasn't much of a duck or salted veg flavour to it.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,19,"While it didn't reek of MSG, it certainly was present."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,20,Pork Dumpling La Mien.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,21,Free oil anyone?
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,22,While the dumpling were decent enough and the noodles were cooked well.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,23,However the soup itself?
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,24,OOOIIILLLYYY.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,25,"While I'm not expert in China or Yangzhou cuisine, I'm pretty sure that he soup isn't meant to THAT oily."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,26,Liu Sha Bao Hmmmm well...
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,27,"I'll give it one positive remark, at least the custard ""flowed"" but that's about it."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,28,It was too sweet and didn't have much of a salted egg taste.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,29,The bun itself was really thick as well.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,30,Not a favorite.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,31,Steamed pork dumpling The only saving grace of the meal.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,32,The bun's flour was the right thickness and the stock inside was really good.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,33,Would have happily eaten 5 of these over the duck soup any day.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,34,Overall... Way below par.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,35,"While the giant bun/dumpling was good, everything else was below average and it takes the cake that, while I'm questioning the staff and commenting out loud that the soup is a joke, the owner (maybe manager) just sits there, in the dining area, looking bored."
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,36,Excuse me but ermmmm..... Thats not very professional.
oLy0od_eQxr4nhqn9eHLwA,37,Will we be back... That's a very decisive N.O.

wJmP1OoEHmYH7H7t-X7Sbg,2,Even when it taste great.
wJmP1OoEHmYH7H7t-X7Sbg,3,"The pork portion is pretty decent, and it's soft in the mouth."

wJmP1OoEHmYH7H7t-X7Sbg,8,Will I still pay $3.50 for a dumpling?
wJmP1OoEHmYH7H7t-X7Sbg,9,Probably.
wG7ZcJeOmb7AzSiIzYlQyA,0,"I tried the chicken dumpling with salted egg yolk, mushroom and chestnut."
wG7ZcJeOmb7AzSiIzYlQyA,1,It is quite big and is soft.
wG7ZcJeOmb7AzSiIzYlQyA,2,That means it sticks to the leaves and it is hard to unwrap it whole.
wG7ZcJeOmb7AzSiIzYlQyA,3,It has tasty though I find it a bit on the salty side.
wG7ZcJeOmb7AzSiIzYlQyA,4,I do love the whole salted egg yolk.

VGxpAc11hiPYctyL2X4etQ,2,"However, the flavors are a bit dull and don't replicate their Penang counterparts well."
VGxpAc11hiPYctyL2X4etQ,3,"The hokkien mee has the right flavor overall, but doesn't pack the spicy punch you would expect of the dish."
VGxpAc11hiPYctyL2X4etQ,4,"Similarly, although much closer to the true dish, the char kway teoh has a bit of charred noodle flavor, but not quite enough excitement to make it excellent."
VGxpAc11hiPYctyL2X4etQ,5,"It seems as if the dishes and recipes are generally correct, but perhaps the ingredients aren't the best or the chef is not the most experienced."
VGxpAc11hiPYctyL2X4etQ,6,"This place is on the verge of having quite good food at a fair price, but it just falls a bit short in terms of flavor."
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,0,Walk along this little segment of Upper Cross Street and you'll inevitably be tempted by the sights and sounds of soy sauce chicken being served.
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,1,"There are two very similar shops lined up not far from each other; this review is about the one further up Upper Cross Street, closer to People's Park Complex, mainly because this is the one my mom has been coming to for years now, and mothers always know best!"
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,2,On the shop front you will see these greasy glistening golden brown chickens hanging as they would in the standard chicken rice stall.
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,3,"The usual order here would be a plate of their famous soy sauce chicken noodles, which manages to balance tastes so that it is not too salty, not too oily, and yet a little bit sweet."
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,4,"The noodles are not the springy sort, yet not too fine, and the texture of the whole thing just works a treat."
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,5,"Of course the chicken is so tender, yet very meaty."
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,6,"The chilli is a wonderful sort of spicy (even for me who is not the biggest fan of spicy), and even a little sweet as well."
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,7,"A portion at $3.50 may not look too sizeable, but I always seem to feel stuffed even without wiping the plate clean, so such good value here!"
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,8,"You may even call in this shop to pre-order for takeaways, so you could drive by and they would deliver right to the car."
jt0zb01PikOSZpUUOV3BVA,9,"If not driving, they would have it prepared for your arrival anyway without any fuss."
q9TvCZHbOCM52ttrN1I7rw,0,"As much as I know, no other frozen yoghurt chains around serves flavors that are as rich as what is served at Berrylite!"
q9TvCZHbOCM52ttrN1I7rw,1,"It's like, the flavors are so special I don't even know if they are still yoghurt or not."
q9TvCZHbOCM52ttrN1I7rw,2,"They have many flavors, including strawberry cheesecake."
q9TvCZHbOCM52ttrN1I7rw,3,"It is supposedly 100% fat-free, so it's the taste of happiness, minus the guilt!"
q9TvCZHbOCM52ttrN1I7rw,4,What a win-win situation it is.
q9TvCZHbOCM52ttrN1I7rw,5,"This is a rather small store, so there are really limited seats around."
q9TvCZHbOCM52ttrN1I7rw,6,More for take-away I think!
Kq02RxsdPSwW9U_ZNknagA,0,"Once Upon A Milkshake (OUAM) has long enchanted milkshake lovers at their outlet at Maxwell Chambers with their gobsmacking range of creations, but you will be glad to know that they have graduated to Orchard Rd."
Kq02RxsdPSwW9U_ZNknagA,1,Grumbling Raisins or Agent Strawberry is sure to knock your socks off as alcoholic rum and rum-soaked raisins are in abundance.
Kq02RxsdPSwW9U_ZNknagA,2,Their milkshakes are not only creamy and thick - they are just plain dreamy.
SjQL36GEqTKd4xkoU997Wg,0,There's no way you can walk into such a gaily coloured shop and still feel down.
SjQL36GEqTKd4xkoU997Wg,1,"On the flipside, there's no way you can walk into such a gaily coloured shop without gagging a little."
SjQL36GEqTKd4xkoU997Wg,2,"The Baskin Robbins at Nex in truth isn't very comfortable, but the ice cream is all you need to distract you from that!"
SjQL36GEqTKd4xkoU997Wg,3,The variety of flavours on display should bring out the kid in everyone.
SjQL36GEqTKd4xkoU997Wg,4,Don't forget to ask the staff behind the counter for a small sample if you're unsure of which one to order.
SjQL36GEqTKd4xkoU997Wg,5,"I've never tried any of their cakes, but the way they stare at me through the glass fridge doors is just unsettling, and I may have to end up buying one one day just so I don't get an unexpected visit in the middle of the night by the cake mob."
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,0,Baskin Robbins formed a major part of my childhood and I was ecstatic when an outlet finally opened at Nex.
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,1,What I really adore about Baskin Robbins is its fun and colourful atmosphere.
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,2,Everything about the brand name reveals youth and pure joy.
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,3,"Some ice-cream flavours I really like are Pistachio Almond, Coconut and the deliciously sweet Pralines 'N Cream."
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,4,"I love ice cream, but I love smoothies and yoghurts even more."
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,5,"Thakfully, the yogurt smoothies in Berry Burst and Mixed Berries flavours are blissfully rewarding."
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,6,"Thick and flavourful, the smoothies gel both the creamy texture of yogurt and fruity flavour of berries to perfection."
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,7,Best enjoyed on a warm day!
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,8,Of course they are not to be outdone by Baskin's signature ice cream shakes.
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,9,Vanilla and strawberry flavours taste best to me.
xtba5Bppo409Cpgks5RuFA,10,"Dine-in is available too although I would have preferred a few more tables and chairs to be placed around the ""island"" stall."
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,0,I thought the bubble tea bubble would burst.
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,1,Apparently not for Singaporeans.
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,2,Even popular foods get a chance at revival if you're really superb at it.
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,3,"Following the footsteps of Koi bubble tea in leading the bubble tea revival, A gantea is a relatively unknown bubble tea shop."
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,4,"Now, I must say that there are many shops that have popped out of nowhere and claim to have been the real deal in bubble tea business with a long history of bubble tea with real authentic skills."
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,5,A gantea seems to be one of them but I was actually convinced that they are actually not bad and might be here to stay to fight with Koi and Gong Cha.
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,6,I ordered their signature A gantea ($3.50 for large) and it tasted pretty good.
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,7,It wasn't so sweet and it had the tea fragrance.
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,8,"While I still feel that it does not beat big players like Koi bubble tea in terms of the blend consistency, I feel that it was good enough for me to be a fan of theirs."
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,9,"For those who are bored of Koi or Gong cha, do give them a try."
G2U7fWyTSK4g0wCfjVLLFQ,10,The prices are really quite cheap as well.
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,0,"Step aside mainstream Japanese restaurant chains (not going to mention which, you know who they are!"
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,1,"), Kinsa's the new in restaurant when it comes to quick, easy, reasonably priced Japanese meals!"
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,2,The location of the restaurant itself is very convenient (those who live in Hillview can attest to this.)
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,3,and it provides a good alternative to the regulars at Railmall which doesn't have a Japanese restaurant.
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,4,I am a huge fan of donburi dishes.
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,5,We ordered a beef donburi and unagi donburi.
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,6,"The quality of the dishes is very good considering the price paid (60+ for two donburis, one sashimi and one sushi dish) as well as the serving time; it took less than 5 minutes for all our food to arrive!"
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,7,"Surprisingly, the food took just as fast to disappear from my bowl."
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,8,It was good enough to satisfy my daily craving for meat on rice.
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,9,Sibei Shiok lah!
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,10,"The sushi roll ordered was only ""ok-ok"" you wouldn't miss out much if you skipped it."
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,11,"That being said, the dishes served were not as warm as I would have expected, this is not to say they were cold but only lukewarm at best."
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,12,But that does not discount the fact that the food is still decently good!!!
4-kA5K44T60GX9gemR7LjA,13,"To sum it up, Kinsa provides a much better and newer alternative for quick and convenient Japanese dinning, definitely worth the shot!"
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,0,"Place is often empty, if not, only a couple few tables occupied."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,1,I can understand why this is so.
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,2,The menu has limited choices which u can choose from.
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,3,"Took me around 15 mins to decide, would be better if they vary their selections."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,4,Ordered a mixed seafood don but was pretty disappointed with the rice.
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,5,"The seafood itself was alright, not super fresh but doable."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,6,But the rice...
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,7,It's dry and hard.
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,8,"The rice they use, if I'm not wrong, is a low grade Japanese rice (Similar to the texture of Vietnamese rice)."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,9,"It feels like a combination of local economy rice together with sashimi, just doesn't work."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,10,"I always believe rice is the most basic/fundamental element to Japanese food and thus, shows how high or how low is the standard of a restaurant."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,11,"With this as a judging factor, I would rank this restaurant low on the scale."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,12,"I cook a lot and am also a fan of Japanese cuisine... the don I had here.. Hmm... Service wise, was good."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,13,"They were friendly, hospitable and accommodating."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,14,Was done with the rice and wanted to order something more hence tried calling the service crew.
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,15,No one attended to me despite calling for 7 times.
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,16,"I gave up and walked over to the cashier, told them I wanted to order more but no one came."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,17,They apologised profusely (it seemed like the chef and waitress was having an intensive chat).
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,18,"They don't charge GST, only service charge."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,19,"Overall, food quality wise, it's slightly below average."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,20,"With the price range, I would rather go for another chain instead of paying for something of a lower quality."
--Qcp71Qz8Didtw4TrB7GQ,21,"So the verdict is, doubt I'll be back again!"
S4i3mPWL7iPcwPZB1i2v1w,0,A place that looks so amazing has average food and high prices.
S4i3mPWL7iPcwPZB1i2v1w,1,It's a little bit downhill from the beginning with this place for me.
S4i3mPWL7iPcwPZB1i2v1w,2,The interior and exterior of this joint has a decent decoration with pretty Ganesha pictures.
S4i3mPWL7iPcwPZB1i2v1w,3,It's lovely because it's spacious and has some very interesting benches just outside.
S4i3mPWL7iPcwPZB1i2v1w,4,"However when i came here for lunch and ordered, the safest bets for good food came out mediocre."
S4i3mPWL7iPcwPZB1i2v1w,5,"That included the gobi manchurian, paneer butter masala and mutton rogan josh."
S4i3mPWL7iPcwPZB1i2v1w,6,The chicken biryani was the only thing i thought was genuinely pretty good.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,0,The food here is solid.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,1,My colleague who knows his Indian food swears by this place and says his friends also call it a favorite.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,2,That's good enough for me.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,3,"Upon being seated, a big banana leaf is placed in front of you and a gentleman walks by with 3 containers full of food to slop off on the leaf."
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,4,"You choose your main dish whether it's a fish curry, mutton this and that, chicken curry, masala, etc."
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,5,I chose the Masala Chicken.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,6,They bring your choice on a small plate and another guy comes by with a big bowl of rice.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,7,"The rice guy is Chinese and I was so tempted to make some kind of inappropriate joke, but I held back."
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,8,"""Why the rice guy gotta be Chinese?"""
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,9,Didn't think it would fly w/ my coworkers.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,10,Anyhoo they give you as much rice as you wish and always come by to give you more if you wish.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,11,Also another guy comes by with your choice of curry sauce (fish or chicken) and drowns the rice in it.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,12,I ate with my hand to go for the full experience.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,13,"Afterwards, they have a couple of nice sinks with good handsoap to wash off the turmeric stains from your fingers."
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,14,After your meal they bring you a small cup of warm tapioca pudding.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,15,It was quite tasty with cashews and some other stringy ingredient (wasn't sure what it was).
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,16,Coworker also urged me to try the butter milk.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,17,First time trying it and that was definitely not the taste I was expecting.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,18,It's like drinking pureed cheese.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,19,Not sure what the bill came out to as colleague generously paid for us 4.
P-3b21NBoEFaVdQo2nOe4A,20,I'd return for a nice Indian meal.
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,0,I was walking around the hood and stumbled on this place by accident.
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,1,"I didn't really know what to expect, no one spoke English, and all I saw were my fellow blue collar friends from different mothers...awesome."
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,2,"With my hand gestures and pointing, the waiter brought a banana leaf, and start dumping food on it...yogurt, curry, yellow rice, list goes on."
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,3,"Funniest part was the rice, the waiter brought this helmet looking metal bowl full of rice."
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,4,"As everyone else, I used my hands to dine."
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,5,I did smell like Indian food all day but so what!?
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,6,It was too much food and I had to fold the leaf as a sign that I had enough.
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,7,"There was no desert, but I got a cup of coffee."
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,8,"Paid about $9, which I think was great deal."
1nnaHeXG7vYRU_ATgcjgfA,9,"This is not a typical touristy joint, and surely not for everyone, but there is nothing wrong with taking a chance on the back alley of Singapore..."
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,0,We had a long layover in Changi from Bali.
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,1,with the time change our meal schedule was super screwed up.
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,2,"but, nonetheless we were hungry."
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,3,"So, we sought out Michi from the directory."
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,4,"There were no reviews on yelp, but we took a chance :) Kept it vegetarian with red curry and biryani and a side of garlic & Â butter naan."
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,5,"The curry had a mild spice to it, which was a nice surprise!"
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,6,"Also, our food was out pretty quick..."
v2ZYPp5aiVb0NJehdA3xaQ,7,I would definitely recommend.
HTrnCgrIj8mYecDHLHL3lA,0,Get sizzling mix grill if you want some fiery flair on your food.
HTrnCgrIj8mYecDHLHL3lA,1,The waiter will dutifully pour some liquor and light the flame on the grilled food.
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,0,"There is finally some proper interest in craft beer in Singapore, thanks to the twin events of the Straits Times article on craft beer by Ms. Anjali Raguaraman to coincide with Beerfest Asia 2016, all in the month of June 2016!"
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,1,"Don't get me wrong, this tsunami's been coming for a while, but the fact that there is enough interest in craft to devote print inches to coincide with a calendar event is for the want of a better word, big."
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,2,"Hop Shop opened well before all this happened, but the point I'm trying to make here, as I also alluded to in my review of Mikkeller Bar's opening in Singapore, is that that there is enough interest in craft beer now in the middle of 2016 to ensure that those of us in the nascent beer geek movement in Singapore get ever more easy access to Â supplies of fresh craft!"
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,3,"While I am not in any way endorsing their entire stock (they also do a trade in aromatherapy), I can vouch for the three beers that I had from the Hop Shop, all from La DÃ©bauche, all fresh and which I have not found anywhere else in Singapore yet."
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,4,"These beers were fresh (I just cannot emphasize how excited I am about this simple, oft taken for granted fact), interesting and well worth all 1000 kCal or so of carbs."
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,5,I'm just happy that the business savvy in Singapore are realizing that it is well worth their while and the aggravation to import fresh craft beer into Singapore because there most certainly is a growing appetite and an almost urgent need to have fresh craft beers with an interesting and sometimes even hip palette of flavors and aromas.
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,6,"That just means that grizzled beer geeks like myself get to ride the wave of hipster interest in craft beer all the way into the shore of the mainstream retail market, Â on this surge of interest in craft beers, enjoying fresh beers without having to endure stale beers served up due to indifference or ignorance."
VRpnFmIMDh93ReWYtZ2z3w,7,"So, when you drop by, say Hi to Luc (the friendly dude behind the aromatherapy counter with the faint French-Singlish accent) and part with some of your precious wampum in exchange for what you might recall years later as your first step into the warm inviting amniotic sac of beer geekdom."
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,0,Recently I read an article saying that 'Mos Burger' is one of the brands from Japan that foreigners can't actually comprehend (because they also relate 'Mos' to 'moss').
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,1,"Many might not know that 'Mos' actually stands for mountain, ocean and sun!"
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,2,"Back to Mos Burger, like aforementioned, it is a brand of burger from Japan."
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,3,"Other than the usual bun burgers, they also have what you call the 'rice burger'."
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,4,This is probably not available anywhere else and is unique to Mos Burger.
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,5,"I don't necessary love rice, but the rice burger at Mos Burger is irresistible!"
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,6,"With the nice Japanese meat patties and sauce to go along, it's a great great match!"
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,7,"The sides, such as the Mos chicken and butterfly prawns are also very delicious!"
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,8,"The Mos chicken in particular, is really crispy and juicy."
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,9,And it does not dirty your hand as they have a special paper packaging that keeps your hands clean.
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,10,I also like to order either the milk tea or the corn soup to go along to complete the meal.
G0iWw2Br8BUy5Np89paV8Q,11,Pretty good for a fast food!
GXE470ySzFefVB9D89_B2Q,0,I was at the mall and starving - never heard of MOS burger so a quick google search revealed it's history and I was of course instantly intrigued.
GXE470ySzFefVB9D89_B2Q,1,I tried the regular chicken burger along with a croquette.
GXE470ySzFefVB9D89_B2Q,2,"The burger was much smaller than I expected and under $5, but I'd almost claim it as 'overpriced' for what the serving really was."
GXE470ySzFefVB9D89_B2Q,3,Pretty flavorful although I couldn't tell if the chicken was overcooked or not.
GXE470ySzFefVB9D89_B2Q,4,"Nonetheless, still a quick enjoyable bite."
GXE470ySzFefVB9D89_B2Q,5,The croquette was soft (and greasy jeeeeez) but nothing personally to write home about.
GXE470ySzFefVB9D89_B2Q,6,"I'd come back and try their other offerings during my next fast food fix... despite the first not as wonderful experience, I'd still definitely prefer this over McDonald's any day."
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,0,I have been wanting to try out Sushi Burrito since I am a huge fan of Sushiritto in San Francisco.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,1,But i wont compare them because they are different although they have similar appearance.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,2,I was a bit skeptical since I heard a lot of my friends that Sushi Burrito is just so-so.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,3,"The first bite, I tried to compare it with what I had in SF."
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,4,But i began to remove those thought as soon as I had my second bite.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,5,They are different.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,6,It taste so good and still fresh although i doubt it when i arrive at the stall and looking at those sushiburrito that already displayed.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,7,They just took those premade sushi and served it.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,8,"Although it is still good, i wish they can make it fresh."
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,9,Idk how it works for people who order half size.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,10,Maybe they will make the fresh version of that?
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,11,Perhaps.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,12,So i just want to conclude my review that Sushi Burrito is a better version of handroll sushi that i usually have.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,13,It taste better than normal sushi or hand roll.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,14,It has good appearance.
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,15,"But perhaps, maybe more experimental flavor/sauce in the future."
4bkqyUGm8tG36rwy-F6_0A,16,Note: the wasabi burned me
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,0,Meh.
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,1,The sushi burrito is alright.
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,2,I've had better and would not recommend this.
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,3,They have a display of their various sushi burrito options on the window for you to choose from.
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,4,You can either get a half burrito or full burrito.
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,5,The rice was bland and the veggies tasted old (not fresh).
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,6,"I Â got the rainbow shrimp burrito, which consisted of prawn tempura."
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,7,However the prawn tempura was mushy and soft on the outside.
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,8,You can tell that the burrito had been sitting out for a while and not fresh.
88HOVV1ewLPo_GLifV4fzQ,9,FYI: It's located at the Changi Airport in the Terminal 1 departure gate near gate C.
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,0,Was there yesterday afternoon.
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,1,"It was many people having sushi as their lunches, so did I!"
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,2,The best I think was the miso soup with tofu and salmon.
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,3,Sushi was ok ok lah with the price of $1.5 per plate(not included 10% service charge and 7% gst).
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,4,But I couldnt ingest the diced octopus one becoz the washabi smell is too strong.
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,5,"Other than that, everything seems alright."
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,6,Everybody was both eating sushi and watching the loved sushi to pick running on the conveyer belt.
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,7,It feels like I needed to eat and needed to work as well haha.
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,8,To me it's affordable when it comes to sushi for my sushi craving.
DDPxAnRTX_TCgPEAS6DNGA,9,Bottom line: I will come back again.
241GXEgW9GMJQRELTA_76w,0,"Not an amazing McDonald's , but at least they didn't charge me for extra pickles!"
241GXEgW9GMJQRELTA_76w,1,"I love those things... Quarter pounder was a bit dry and the pickles were thrown at the burger, however flavour remained the same as all the others in the world."
241GXEgW9GMJQRELTA_76w,2,They have this machine that transports food upstairs (I have no idea where as I didn't go up there...) which makes it seem Super high tech!
241GXEgW9GMJQRELTA_76w,3,Good for a snack or meal when not much is open.
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,0,"This is the only Western cuisine stall in the Hwa Chong Institution College Canteen, but its standard is far from satisfactory."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,1,"Most of its dishes have mushroom, which some people including me are allergic about."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,2,"As a result, we are left with no choice but to eat the tomato sauce spaghetti, fish and chips or another dish with butter and spaghetti."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,3,"The stall owner has used Italian names for almost all the dishes, and since I am not an Italian, I was unable to remember the names clearly."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,4,"To me, the tomato sauce spaghetti is the best the stall can offer."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,5,It is quite delicious with suffient sauce poured onto the spaghetti.
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,6,"It costs S$2.50, but it is too little to eat."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,7,"Even if you add 50 cents more to order a bigger plate of it, it is still not very sufficient."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,8,Fish and chips is the stall's worst dish.
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,9,"Fish fried till it is too stiff to cut, and french fries mixed until they are too salty to eat."
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,10,"In short, this stall CMI!"
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,11,"(a very unique Singaporean acronym of ""can't make it!"")"
C9Z7Y4wIY7tHB9I1Qm60tA,12,"Hopefully, next year a new vendor will replace this current vendor."
R8ZVYXlV3X8u07m8hUo6Ow,0,"The million dollar questions: how are they the no.1 korean chicken chain, and how did they survive for 5 years here."
R8ZVYXlV3X8u07m8hUo6Ow,1,What a waste of precious calories.
2p_z1fDc246hvJc9G0cm8Q,0,"This place exudes the kind of Southern country charm that the eponymous country singer Kenny Rogers possesses, serving up good ol' Americana at a rather reasonable price."
2p_z1fDc246hvJc9G0cm8Q,1,"I know the place is famous for its chicken, but I was in no mood of that ubiquitous meat, so I ordered Baked Fish with Garlic Parsley Potatoes and Steamed Garden Vegetables as my sides."
2p_z1fDc246hvJc9G0cm8Q,2,"The vegetables were standard fare, while the potatoes were rather excellent."
2p_z1fDc246hvJc9G0cm8Q,3,"The purplish pink skin of the potatoes was intact, and the fragrance of garlic and parsley made this side dish a particularly appetising one."
2p_z1fDc246hvJc9G0cm8Q,4,"The baked fish was good, though the way it was presented on the plate - without any garnish or sauce at all - was pretty austere."
2p_z1fDc246hvJc9G0cm8Q,5,"Service was prompt, with my fish arriving in less than the 15 minutes that the waitress informed me it would take to prepare."
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,0,It's ok for when I have a sushi craving and don't want to spend much and I want it quick.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,1,It's actually 2 counters side by side with the sushi display in the middle.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,2,The left counter is for the sushi and they sell some rice bowls and chawanmushi as well.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,3,The right counter is for udon.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,4,I've been twice.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,5,Both times the sushi selection was not much to speak of at all but it tasted decent.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,6,"They usually have things like inari (sweet beancurd), hana maki (salmon wrapped around rice with mayo - way too much mayo so I scraped off as much as I could), sometimes salmon sashimi, tamago, chuka hotate (seasoned scallop), crab stick."
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,7,The basic sushi are sold in pairs around $1.80.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,8,"They have sushi packed sets for about $6.80 to $11+, basic salad with salmon sashimi on top and small bowls of cha soba."
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,9,The rice was not hard and dry thank goodness.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,10,I also tried the curry udon for about $5.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,11,It was simple comfort food served piping hot.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,12,They call out your number for you to collect when it is ready so you can start chomping on your sushi first while waiting.
lwkRp3GbnStxhJRQrCw6dA,13,You can choose to sit either side of the sitting areas as it's all the same company.
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,0,Meh...that is exactly how I felt.
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,1,Went for a late lunch and they are already out of sashimi.
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,2,"I took a glance at the menu and it is mostly salmon anyway, not my favorite fish."
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,3,Ordered the oyako don.
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,4,It is at best food court quality.
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,5,"There is more egg than meat, so much chicken skin (read: fat) in the bowl that I resorted to picking out the skin...not cool."
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,6,Food court quality Japanese at $9.
ijfLFhKlGfCy01NwPFuoWw,7,No like.
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,0,Richie's Cripsy Puff which is located in Jurong East operates around the clock.
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,1,Yes!
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,2,24 hrs and I'm not kidding.
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,3,They offer an interesting spread of variety ranging from the traditional chicken curry puff to durian.
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,4,"Their puff comes in a standard size different from the typical ones (half an oval shape), like those from Old Chang Kee."
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,5,The crust was fried to perfection brown and was very crispy.
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,6,"Sold for $2.40 for 2, customer can feel free to match any 2 flavours at the pricing."
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,7,The selling point of Richie's puff is its delicate handmade craftwork on each and every puff.
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,8,"With such method, they have more control over the quality, thus its crispiness is of a different levels unlike the others."
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,9,"The fillings comprised of egg, noticeable chicken chunks, mixed well in the fragrant curry flavou."
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,10,"The curry was a little big mild for me, for those who do not like too much spice, this may fit the bill."
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,11,"Muslims pal out there, no worries, this stall is Halal Certified."
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,12,What's more this is a good place to look out for snack when hunger pangs in the middle of the night where most eateries are already closed for the day.
1Vr4qQGsdXwDZBt-Ch84Rg,13,Perfect for Morning shifts or night shifts workers too!
NXjVvza7TNmKGqF3LHypQA,0,"I had the luxury of strawberry shortcake not too long ago, when my colleagues decided that a birthday without a cake is not a birthday."
NXjVvza7TNmKGqF3LHypQA,1,"It's not hard to see why the strawberry shortcake is one of PG's bestsellers - airy sponge, light fresh cream, and succulent strawberries."
NXjVvza7TNmKGqF3LHypQA,2,Most cream cakes are hard to go down after a couple of bites due to the cloying cream or sponge being too dry.
NXjVvza7TNmKGqF3LHypQA,3,Not this baby though.
NXjVvza7TNmKGqF3LHypQA,4,"Even after a heavy dinner, we still managed to wolf an entire cake down, and no strawberries were spared."
NXjVvza7TNmKGqF3LHypQA,5,"Dainty is the word that comes to mind here, and you can envision yourself sitting with a mug of tea, pinky finger up while digging into the cake."
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,0,Third log cake of the year for me and this one is special!
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,1,It's a banana chocolate log cake!
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,2,"At $64 for a 1.1kg cake it is quite pricey, more expensive than the 1kg $68 Mont Blanc log cake I had from Marriott just 2 days ago but I like this cake so much better!"
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,3,The dark chocolate is not too bitter as the cream is fluffy and light!
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,4,The banana in the center is sweet and adds colour to the cake as well!
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,5,"I really like how the cake has an ""old"" and ""natural"" tree, log look to it!"
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,6,"It is cute and delicious, definitely the first cake to score on both criterias!"
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,7,I do not feel gerlat from eating this dark chocolate banana log cake like I did with the chocolate truffle prima deli log cake.
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,8,"As a result, I couldn't help going for seconds with this log cake!!"
xdWEWhMX4t3WPXP-s_hPOw,9,A light and delicious way to end a Christmas party!
CM9zz0IIi-uxrPDEuM_KFg,0,There is nothing good to say about the food at Burger King here.
CM9zz0IIi-uxrPDEuM_KFg,1,Don't eat here unless you are desperate ... which I was !
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,0,Very decent and tasty Wagyu beef burger.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,1,Kinda taste like overeasy's truffle beef burger but just a tad harder.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,2,TOP $2 for cheese Fries instead of the regularly fries.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,3,I like the herbs in their regular side Fries.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,4,Also got an ABC fruit juice with no ice for $7.50.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,5,"Ordered pizzas which, am surprised they were hand made, not your typical refrigerated frozen pizza."
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,6,There's always just a couple of tables taken even though the food here is pretty good.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,7,"I'm guessing it's because of the restaurants overall look and feel (branding), it doesn't seem appealing..."
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,8,"This is a halal restaurant, great for people who are looking for alternatives!"
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,9,"They have bacon in their menu, but fret not, cos it's turkey bacon haha.I'll definitely come here again the next time I'm waiting for arrival flights."
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,10,Ice creams come in very local flavour i.e.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,11,Chendol/Milo.
9WxGfH57sflruXb08GbaIQ,12,"Would also love to try their ice lychee tea, seems Super appealing, pity I've got only one stomach!"
MG87oaoNNwIKo_cQ31ULOQ,0,Super good value with their $5 express lunches.
MG87oaoNNwIKo_cQ31ULOQ,1,A hidden gem of a place at the outer fringes of the CBD.
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,0,The stall uncle happens to be one of disciples of the 4 heavenly kings of Singapore Cantonese cuisine.
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,1,That itself should speak about the quality of food here.
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,2,An added bonus?
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,3,"One of the pioneers of roast - fatty ox; located just next door :) If you're here for ambience and service, don't expect any."
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,4,"But if you're here for some delicious, restaurant standard cze char served in little claypots, you've come to the right place."
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,5,Recommendations include the sweet and sour pork ( made with real hawthorn!
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,6,"), kong pao chicken (order this or you'll regret), seafood tofu, pork ribs, crab meat shark fin soup (it uses fish maw despite its name)."
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,7,Absolute perfection for a cze char stall.
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,8,Only downside is it's in a hawker centre and you'll sweat eating hot claypot food.
YhfCvQgXX6foP-qzTaboYQ,9,Small Price to pay anyways.
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,0,My girlfriend and I have been regulars here since we moved to Singapore.
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,1,"In fact, to call us regulars is a bit of an understatement."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,2,We have come here at least 6 times a week for nearly a year and a half.
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,3,This place is a true gem.
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,4,"Mrs. Seow's cooking talents are beyond belief, and Mr. Seow, who serves the food, is a wonderful, gracious and welcoming man."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,5,"The food served here is best described as Buddhist (meaning no garlic or onions), organic, vegetarian."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,6,The menu is simple: each day there are 3-4 things written on a board outside.
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,7,"The first dish on the menu is always a rice-set, which consists of brown rice and side vegetables which change each day."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,8,"The second item on the menu is a noodle dish, which also changes each day."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,9,Other items include interesting (and generally quite healthy) desserts.
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,10,"Some of my favorite dishes here are: Chinese pancake wraps, cold noodles, Sichuan noodle and thunder tea rice."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,11,"You'll have to call ahead to find out when these will be served, but show up for lunch or dinner any day of the week and you can't go wrong."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,12,"At $5.50 for the noodle dishes and $6.00 for the rice set, you can't go wrong."
OR-XH1kwQ7C_OZj1W12k-g,13,"If food is medicine, then this place will add years to your life."

bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,0,Giovanni L. is owning a repertoire of 102 international ice cream varieties.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,1,Most of them are made with our own recipe.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,2,"Each year 2 to 3 new flavors of ice cream will be created and several of their gelato flavours are international award winners!Seattle Pike Chowder is under the same management as Giovanni L., and the gelato brought in directly from Germany and decorated in Singapore."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,3,It is hard to turn down a scoop of delicious and fresh gelato!
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,4,"At one glance, you will notice several different types of chowders and you can havethem with a bread bowl, or in a cup."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,5,Seattle Pike Peak's chowder also offers sandwiches and a combo for a sandwich and a chowder.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,6,They also have a small selection of cakes and pastries but the cakes looked abit dry and stale and I decided to get a muffin instead.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,7,They also serve imported chilled beers which can go very nicely with gelato.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,8,1.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,9,Chocolate Gelato Spaghetti $12.90 A very interesting creation that can only be found at Giovanni is gelato spaghetti.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,10,"They have a few flavours, namely, chocolate, vanilla and berries."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,11,"I decided to go with chocolates as it came with almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,12,That's a lot of nuts!
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,13,"I was surprised at it's presentation, with 2 waffle biscuits at the side."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,14,It was nothing like I've ever had before.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,15,The gelato was nice with chocolate syrup drizzled over it.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,16,"The gelato here isn't very sweet and is generally milder in flavour, probably the lack of using artificial flavouring."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,17,Underneath the gelato is whipped cream which gives the entire dish a light and creamy feel.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,18,There were so much nuts that I had a nut in every spoonful.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,19,"A truly interesting dish, but even though it is gelato stringed into spaghetti, the ice cream melts too fast for you to twirl the ice cream spaghetti up like real spaghetti noodles."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,20,2.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,21,"Apple Cinnamon muffin $3.90The apple cinnamon muffin is pretty sizable with a crunchy and almost crispy like top, that is filled with crusty cinnamon crunch."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,22,The muffin on the inside was a dense with a cinnamon aroma and essence.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,23,"There were cubes of apples wrapped around in cinnamon sauce, similar to what you find in a McDonald's apple pie on the inside of the muffin."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,24,It was surprise to me.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,25,It was pretty good muffin and I'm definitely getting it again next time 3.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,26,"Smoked Salmon Chowder in a Breadbowl $12.90 This chowder very interesting, as a huge fan of smoked salmon I was intrigued by the tastes."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,27,Seattle's Pike Chowder managed to capture the essence of the smoked salmon blend it in with cream cheese and TA-DA!
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,28,You have an amazing bowl of smoked salmon chowder.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,29,I highly recommend this to any fellow smoked salmon lover!
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,30,"The taste of the smoked salmon comes in strong, as an aftertaste."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,31,"This was a very creamy bowl of soup, not much to bite into, just good, flavourful chowder."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,32,A good compliment to any sandwich.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,33,"Since this place is literally marketed with ""Seattle"" on the signboard, all their chowders come directly from Seattle on a daily basis, to ensure top-notch quality."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,34,Their bread however is made locally.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,35,The bread definitely isn't the same bread I had in Seattle.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,36,"It was alot fluffier and not as tough, it may suit the locals more, but it is definitely a change."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,37,4.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,38,"After Eight ice cream (single scoop) The After Eight was very rich and not as creamy as you would expect, it had a slightly rough texture which would indicate the mint bits embedded into the gelato."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,39,"As with any ice cream parlour in Singapore, they melt fast!"
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,40,But the dining here at Fort Canning is well cooled with power air conditioning.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,41,Having a wide range of gelatos gives me a feeling they are out to fight the already competitive gelato market.
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,42,"They do not offer typical flavours such as matcha or cookies and cream, but rather very unique flavours like Amorena which is a vanilla gelato with amorena cherries."
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,43,It will blow your mind!
bm8Ul4vwaPVIuWdBD4CKmw,44,Think of a super awesome raspberry ripple!
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,0,The frozen yogurt chain is well known in Singapore and has been around for quite awhile.
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,1,Recently the chain has introduced the Splitz which one can have unlimited choices in flavours of frozen yogurt and toppings.
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,2,There is one kiosk outlet at ION Orchard.
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,3,"There was 4 flavours of frozen yogurt available : natural, mango, peach, and macadamia nut."
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,4,There was a wide range of toppings priced from $0.95 for jelly bean to $2 for macaroon crunch.
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,5,"As the weather was super hot and there was no queue at the outlet, I decided to order a Splitz as there was too many toppings which I wanted."
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,6,"As I made my choices in toppings, a queue started to form behind me."
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,7,I'm surprised to find a queue stretched to next door by the time I finished making payment.
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,8,"The Splitz ($5.90) I had selected 4 different flavours for my Splitz : Mango flavour yogurt, topped with French vanilla roasted oats, Macadamia Nut flavour yogurt, topped with caramel syrup & macaroon crunch, Natural flavour yogurt, topped with dried cranberries & strawberry syrup, Peach flavour yogurt, topped with peach."
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,9,The mango flavour yogurt tasted the best among the 4 flavours as it has most distinct flavour.
8AdI_fo4y6QV6us45GPVmA,10,"As for the toppings, I like the macaroon crunch the most as it tasted crunchy with hint of salty taste."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,0,"With pasta and risotto stalls opening up in Old Airport Road hawker centre, it is a sign that locals now enjoy western and local food all in one location!"
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,1,"Jogurtz is a newly opened stall at the hawker centre, located on the inner rows."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,2,"It has a brightly lit stall size with a cheerful logo and a simple menu, small frozen yogurt (froyo) or a large froyo."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,3,"The small serving is served with 1 fruit and 1 topping at just $3.50 and the large is served with 2 Fruits/Toppings, 2 fruits and 1 topping at $5."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,4,"At one glance, you will notice that they are priced lower than competitors at shopping malls, but one must also consider the lower operating costs and human traffic at this location I picked strawberries, which they gave a generous serving of them, but some strawberries were sweet and some were sour, it was an interesting mix as the froyo itself was icy and sourish."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,5,"I like the sour taste as I would rather than a sour tasting froyo than a super sweet and milky froyo, which goes to say how much sugar they toss into the machine!"
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,6,"I also got the Post cereal, Cranberry almond crunch which gave me a crunchy bite in every mouthful, a perfect combination for the soft froyo!I must admit, the small serving is alot larger than I expected, and I checked, both the small and the large serving have almost the same amount of froyo, the large just has more room for toppings."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,7,"The froyo started melting instantly once I was done snapping a couple of photos, this is expected as Jogurtz is situated in a hawker centre and our weather is not favourable to ice cold froyo."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,8,"But nonetheless, the froyo held up till I managed to scoop to the bottom."
lgubA4NM0PfLL2mkZLg8uw,9,It didn't melt into a froyo drink which was surprising!
BacS93ofNOVFs8Q8rPNoxQ,0,Ben & Jerry's as usual very delicious.

WWE_OORHPGCUW-XJC4FqNQ,1,and I love Glory mee siam.
WWE_OORHPGCUW-XJC4FqNQ,2,More than any other mee siam.
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,0,Muslim Nasi Padang.
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,1,Basically Muslim mixed rice.
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,2,I couldn't have stumbled upon this place since it was quite hidden.
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,3,I had to ask for directions.
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,4,"On the 3rd floor, beside the bridge across People Park and Chinatown Point, next to the UOB ATM."
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,5,The taste is authentic.
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,6,"The curry chicken somehow looks ""overnight"" but a bite tells otherwise."
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,7,"The sides are very surprisingly mild to the palate, not too spicy, just right."
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,8,Sweet is the word.
5Kc7sUcqBGN9rRRImzB9HA,9,"For $5.70 it is slightly pricey, but that's what we pay in town."
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,0,My fave store in this whole Food Court!
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,1,"Not only is the food amazing, the options are huge, portions are huge and the service is pretty great."
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,2,"I love the Aunties here - they are so sweet, homely and remind me of my own Grandmother - who always loves stuffing me with food like a goose."
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,3,"Not only are there local Malay food - but they sell desserts too - from traditional Indonesian to Western tarts, pies and curry puffs - they really have quite the edge."
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,4,What I Love: Getting rice and all the yummy veggies and meat.
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,5,"Ayam Masak Merah is so good, with Sambal Goreng, Lemak curry, and you can get add Paru, Sotong Sambal, or Ketchup Fish, eggs, bean sprouts, beans, tempeh, etc., and the list just goes on and on and on......"
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,6,I've tried almost all their options - and it's just all so good.
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,7,Not particularly healthy - but just oh so good.
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,8,"Have tried their Mee Siam, Mee Rebus and Lontong too."
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,9,Yummmmmm!
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,10,"For a time, they had Tahu Goreng and I ate that EVERY DAY."
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,11,And they stopped doing it and I literally was crushed.
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,12,Oh well.
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,13,I decided to bury my sorrows by stuffing myself with sambal goreng - and the world is all right again!
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,14,What I Don't Love: Nothing!!!!
FTWtmxY-ypgubmqzu5hVVQ,15,!
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,0,This place is poppin' at lunch time.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,1,We went a little bit late so were able to grab seats without waiting.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,2,The food is delicious and won't break the bank.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,3,"We both had Chinese tea which was ok. For food, we ordered: -Wasabi prawns."
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,4,This came in an edible basket.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,5,The prawns weren't that spicy.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,6,-Coffee pork ribs.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,7,"Yes, coffee."
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,8,It may some weird but it's really good.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,9,"It doesn't taste too strongly of coffee, just a nice of hint of coffee that gives these crispy pork ribs good flavor."
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,10,-Yang chow fried rice: can't go wrong with fried rice.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,11,They did not skimp on the char siew or prawns either.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,12,-Sambal kang kong: not too spicy either.
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,13,Amazing!
u1uuZ-Y7FHwdi30Q57PTDw,14,"Overall, a great place for Chinese food!"
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,0,"This place, tucked away in the upper tower floors of the vast west coast mall was a bit of pleasant surprise."
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,1,"The chicken was moist, juicy, and cooked wonderfully."
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,2,"Oddly enough, for a place with good food and lots of guests, there was only one person working the dining room."
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,3,"I'd give the one-man-show running the place 20 stars for how courteous he was, his effort, and proficiency in making the place work."
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,4,It was quite remarkable to see him doing such an excellent job and working so hard to make things happen.
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,5,"If he's not the owner, I hope he goes off and opens his own place instead of working here."
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,6,"Meanwhile, I suggest to the owners that you hire more people like this and make things run better."
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,7,"You already have tasty chicken, so make it a go-to place for guests by offering the service that bring people in and keep them satisfied."
kA7Nmb_rUVJeBep7c4IWTQ,8,"Why have only one staff member when you could fill an entire dining room with happy customers, instead of having many people see no one is available and choosing to go somewhere else?"
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,0,Like a vege loaded meal served within minutes?
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,1,Paik's Bibim is your lunch choice then!
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,2,"It is a Korean style fast food - order at the counter, wait for your number to ding and come pick it up."
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,3,The dishes are inspired by the Korean staple Bibimbap.
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,4,"You can get it with rice or noodle and your choice of meat, or tofu for even more vege!"
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,5,Their service is fast and efficient while still friendly.
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,6,"Need sometime to check out their menu, no prob, take your time."
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,7,The price is reasonable at $6.90 - $8.90 for a bowl of satisfying size.
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,8,The only downside is finding a place to sit.
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,9,It is very popular with the lunch crowd but have limited seatings.
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,10,"No worries, get a to-go!"
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,11,They pack your rice/noodle separate from the veggies so you don't have to worry about your veggies getting too soggy.
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,12,"Oh, the meal also come with a bowl of soup."
Z9ZNLKXuUQD0k4I-Oa0Fjw,13,"It may be pricier than the North Spine Canteen but for the fresh veggies, I think it is worth it!"
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,0,Ok that was damn tasty.
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,1,"On a Chinatown side street across from a hawker center and a parking ramp with Singapore's ""Eat Street"" on the other side, this place stands a good chance of being passed over but it had a lot to like."
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,2,"Live seafood tanks, late hours, cold beer and some tables outside under shade and fans."
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,3,"The couple that own it are very pleasant, eager to have your business, and the food is great."
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,4,The spicy Sichuan pepper and chili oil beef had my mouth numb at first bite.
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,5,Actually felt kind of lame eating it since I am not accustomed to Singapore's heat and humidity and I was dripping sweat trying to get through the dish.
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,6,Kind of a sadomasochistic eating outing for me but what pleasure from the pain.
XI28EJeC_f3v1o4aa2Najg,7,I would have no reservations coming back.
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,0,Expensive popsicles by the Bay.
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,1,"4 star for taste, 2 star for price."
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,2,read about Frostbite one day so decided to bring the missus and mom in law to try it out.
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,3,"The taste is wholesome, just like any of the artisan homemade ice-cream stores popping up across Singapore but the Popsicle version."
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,4,the good thing is that it is made with real fruits and has no gelatin or artificial flavoring and preservatives.
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,5,They even have Mao Shan Wang durian Popsicle for the Singapore durian fanatics.
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,6,"they also do deliveries for min 20 sticks, great for parties."
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,7,"its location is fantastic, facing the Merlion directly, and naturally it is priced fantastically expensive too."
c_uVgshSLrrw5tUcOusbRg,8,"sadly with the exorbitant rent of ""fantastic locations"", I hope it will be able to survive long enough to be more than a fad."
lAAkTC37lDHelYdq01o61A,0,Delicious fresh ice block ready to cool you down and rehydrate after wandering around in the Singapore humidity!!
lAAkTC37lDHelYdq01o61A,1,"They sell for $5 a pop, which is on the pricer side but worth it for the refreshment."
lAAkTC37lDHelYdq01o61A,2,I got the Watermelon and my friend got the Orange and Pineapple.
5lzkzY4DEXaBpNe3Y1Hkkg,0,This foodstall is located at the Anchorpoint Foodcourt on Basement 1 at the far right end of the mall.
5lzkzY4DEXaBpNe3Y1Hkkg,1,"Don't be confused by the name Osaka Cuisine, because this place has nothing to do with Osaka which together with Kyoto has 97 michelin stars, and it also has nothing do with Cuisine."
5lzkzY4DEXaBpNe3Y1Hkkg,2,It's just a Korean foodstall at the anchorpoint foodcourt.
5lzkzY4DEXaBpNe3Y1Hkkg,3,Food is not bad.
5lzkzY4DEXaBpNe3Y1Hkkg,4,"The bibimbap has a good amount of flavor and balanced portion of meat, veggies and rice."
5lzkzY4DEXaBpNe3Y1Hkkg,5,"It is one of the most popular stall in the foodcourt, also because the prices are reasonable."
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,0,It's hard not to fall in love with Ng Kim Lee.
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,1,It is increasingly rare to find a 'traditional' bakery like this outside the heartlands.
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,2,"Well, I guess it isn't all that traditional."
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,3,"They do still sell the old school biscuits and little snacks, as well as some of the classic cakes, but what they're most famous for are their custard and durian puffs."
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,4,When you buy them you'll have to buy a few at a go.
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,5,I know I can't leave with any less than ten.
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,6,The moment you get it you're just tempted into popping it straight into your mouth.
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,7,"the skin is nice and thin and isn't too fluffy, and envelopes a wonderfully casual and sweet (but not too sweet!)"
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,8,bundle of custard.
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,9,I bought a box of six ($2.40) for my friends to try and they were so convinced they got a few each themselves.
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,10,"I can't quite describe their durian puffs so well because I'm oddly averse to durians, but both of them sell out like hotcakes, so you know they're worth it!"
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,11,"They also do really good muffins of various flavours - lemon, blueberry, chocolate, and as you would expect form a fresh bakery they manage to get the density and texture all spot on."
MCTSyVSRp4ijXxaJ0S5_kw,12,"I enjoy their cakes as well - they come in so many players and aren't very expensive, so I try a new one every time and it never disappoints!"
Tx3ILqWmxsoPBMoJpBj1PA,0,Like Italian ice but 10 times better!
Tx3ILqWmxsoPBMoJpBj1PA,1,Try the durian or coconut!
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,0,"If you have watched the Mediacorp Channel U reality tv game show ""Buzzing Cashiers"" (), you'll most likely recognise the owners of Bee Garden."
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,1,"From what I understand, they were the winners of one of the season of the show."
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,2,This stall is not new at the Commonwealth Crescent Market.
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,3,"They were around even when the stall was still at the old market, prior to its upgrading."
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,4,The family business has gone through quite a tough patch but the mother and son team can be cranky but they do make fantastic dessert!
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,5,Their best selling dessert is the ice mango pomelo dessert!
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,6,The pomelo is fresh and each one burst its juice with every bite.
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,7,The mango too is sweet and a perfect contrast with the slightly sour bites of pomelo.
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,8,The durian penyet is also worth trying but better eaten on the spot as the shaved ice are smooth and soft and wouldn't survive well with travelling or refreezing.
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,9,Personal favourite is the ice bo bo char char which uses melted gula melaka dressing on the ice shaving.
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,10,The dessert of yam and sweet potato is usually eaten hot but I love this cold and theirs is one of the best.
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,11,"The hot desserts are under $1, definitely cheap and value for money too."
_BfG7PUdEnBpJau5tjGhrg,12,But unfortunately they only open in the afternoon so remember not to go too early.
gU03mCw3xmF7pQN3m-3drA,0,I'm not familiar with this chain although their menu says they are a famous noodle shop in Osaka with over 200 stores.
gU03mCw3xmF7pQN3m-3drA,1,They are very proud of their Udon and Soba noodles.
gU03mCw3xmF7pQN3m-3drA,2,They charge quite a premium for the soba noodles.
gU03mCw3xmF7pQN3m-3drA,3,I didn't think it was anything great.
gU03mCw3xmF7pQN3m-3drA,4,"The food here is average, the service is sub-par."
gU03mCw3xmF7pQN3m-3drA,5,I get the sense that the employees here are not very happy and it makes you feel uncomfortable as a patron.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,0,"Inspired by the ""Cook a pot of curry"" day, I decided to have curry for dinner last Sunday."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,1,"But I had a craving for Jap curry, which is not so in line with the theme I suppose, but it is still curry, no?"
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,2,Heh.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,3,"I thought hard about places with good Jap curry in Singapore, but my mind drew a blank."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,4,"Scoured the net for good recommendations, but that did not yield substantial results."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,5,"My sporadic love for Jap curry started after a long tiring day at Tokyo Disneysea about 2 years back, when Ter and I were on our way back to our hotel for the night."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,6,"Those who have been to Disneysea, or Disneyland will know that running around the place to catch the best rides is like some sort of physically demanding amazing race."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,7,"Coupled with the exorbitantly priced F&B inside, it is suffice to say that we were both damn hungry and spent at the end of the excursion."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,8,"So at a particular JR station where we changed trains, we popped into one of those eat-by-the-counter eatery, where you purchase food coupons via a vending machine, in exchange for the food."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,9,"So as you might have already guessed, it was a curry shop, and when the order came, we scarfed down the curry rice like we had been starved for a long time."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,10,And that is when I started to appreciate Jap curry.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,11,"Something about the mix of sweet, spicy and savory that drew me in."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,12,Especially love the red pickled veg that comes with it (think it's called fukujinzuke)!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,13,"Funnily enough, the other yummy Jap curries I've had was in LA, at Hurry Curry, Sawtelle."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,14,So I find it odd that I can't find any good recommended Jap curry in SG.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,15,"One name stood out though, from all the scouring on the web, and it was Go!"
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,16,Go!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,17,Curry!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,18,"Located at the ION Orchard food basement, I vaguely remember seeing it, when its name appeared in the searches."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,19,"All the reviews seemed favourable, so headed there for a nice Jap curry dinner."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,20,"We settled for the Grand Slam because we could nt decide which katsu to get, and the grand slam had a bit of everything."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,21,We even added shrimp because there was only 1 miserly shrimp in the Grand Slam.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,22,"When our order came, we sized up the situation pretty quickly (this would be called appreciation of situation in my line of work) and opined that we needed more curry, so we topped up $3 for additional curry."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,23,"Between the chicken katsu and the pork katsu, I preferred the chicken; thought that the pork was a bit tough, but maybe I have just been spoilt by Tonkichi or Tetsu, lol."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,24,"Other than that, the curry was creamy and tasty!"
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,25,"Not too spicy, and was a seamless blend of sweet and savoury."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,26,My only gripe was that there wasn't any of the red pickled vege that I so love.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,27,Alas!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,28,"I would have loved to finish the entire container of it, like what we did in Tokyo."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,29,"Then again, who does that right?"
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,30,:p Go!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,31,Go!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,32,Hurry!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,33,is ideal for a satisfying Jap curry meal that is also value for money.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,34,Worth a try if you are into Jap curry.
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,35,"Oh, and they also have various serving sizes (with inventive names) for the rice, ranging from economy class to first class."
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,36,"So for those folks who are carbo loading, or love to eat rice, it's first class for the win; else economy class should do the trick!"
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,37,"So go, go, go to Go!"
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,38,Go!
uw0HuLyZNHn6gesyum4pqg,39,Curry!
6OvTbI9RvN-W1Ps5WMI5Zg,0,Looking for a convenient place to have a quick dinner on a crowded Saturday night and stumbled on this new - to me at least - eatery in the basement of Paragon.
6OvTbI9RvN-W1Ps5WMI5Zg,1,"The speciality is gyu katsu, which comes on a little sizzling hotplate for you to tweak the doneness of the steak to your liking."
6OvTbI9RvN-W1Ps5WMI5Zg,2,The service is fairly prompt because of the automated ordering system and the food comes quickly.
6OvTbI9RvN-W1Ps5WMI5Zg,3,They have a very nice sparkling sake on the menu and the food is decent.
6OvTbI9RvN-W1Ps5WMI5Zg,4,Good mid-priced place to grab a quick meal.
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,0,"I'm posting it on behalf of KFC delivery, idk which outlet they sent my food from but since I stay nearby Thomson plaza so I'm guessing it's the one at there."
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,1,"Anyway, as usual I have never had high expectation on any fast food joint, let alone KFC, although it's much better than McD."
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,2,So my craving for fried chicken came out of nowhere when I was home and decided to try KFC's delivery service.
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,3,"Ordered chicken nuggets, original rice bucket and popcorn chicken."
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,4,"For a fast food chain, seems like they're doing their job in an above average manner."
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,5,I'm very impressed about several things: 1.
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,6,"They separate their mushroom sauce for the rice bucket to prevent it being soggy on the way so when it finally reached home, I was like MAN they know about all these basic things and 4 thumbs up for this."
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,7,"Also, seems like they gave more chickens for take-away."
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,8,The rice to chicken ratio is perfect too!
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,9,2.
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,10,Actual delivery time is actually much faster than estimated time (like 15 mins faster and hell yea it matters to a starving woman).
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,11,3.
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,12,I ordered chicken nuggets for the first time from KFC and they taste DOPE!
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,13,Like really!
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,14,"So fresh, tasted like real minced chicken breasts and free chipotle bbq dipping sauce!"
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,15,I must say $3.5 delivery cost is totally worth it!
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,16,Although they do have $12 amount as minimum order charge which is understandable.
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,17,"They also have weekdays promo, and I opted for the $6 for 2 portions of popcorn chicken which is only valid on mondays!"
h9nQC_zCkSLCzWhoZXGisA,18,Really made my day!

9W478H__flwtwGuKqFWDQw,24,Pay bill.
9W478H__flwtwGuKqFWDQw,25,(I paid RM29 for 3 people)
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,0,This is a old style cake shop located at the HDB housing estate.
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,1,This cake shop was around since the 80s and so had a long history.
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,2,"Having stand the test of time, it being still in business means they are making the stuff correct."
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,3,"The variety of breads and buns are plentiful, you can get both savory and sweet buns."
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,4,"Savoury ones includes the Singapore laksa bun, otak bun as well as the usual sausage roll, chicken mushroom bun and egg ham bun."
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,5,"Sweet varieties included Apple chestnut, cheese blueberry plus other assorted fruits buns."
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,6,Not all types are available each day.
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,7,The buns are nice and they are cheaper than the newer bakery around .
1_DgtD-8A9OV1ZVVVoRhTw,8,You can also get various cakes.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,0,"First, NO :( Please do not replace all the Starbucks in Singapore with Tai Cheong Bakery as suggested by another yelper."
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,1,I love my Tai Cheong egg tarts but I can't forsake my love for Starbucks too.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,2,"Tai Cheong Bakery is the down to earth, simple practical guy one would not go wrong."
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,3,Starbucks is the romantic charming guy who just draws one in.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,4,I have written reviews on Tai Cheong bakery in Hong Kong.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,5,"I love egg tarts, not from anywhere else but just from Tong Heng in Singapore and Tai Cheong in Hong Kong."
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,6,Tai Cheong Bakery has finally made its appearance in this sunny island since last year.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,7,I heard there were long lines where it first opened.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,8,I do not stand in crazy lines for food or anything.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,9,Reminded me once upon a time when patrons had to stand in long lines to enter the most popular clubs.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,10,I guessed I was lucky no one made me stand in lines; my legs would give way by standing for too long!!
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,11,":O Not sure if it is psychological, the Tai Cheong egg tarts I bought in Sg were very good but I somehow thought they were slightly different from those I bought in Hong Kong."
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,12,Perhaps the next time I would try to eat it on the spot once I bought them.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,13,Minimum purchase of the egg tarts is 4 pieces.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,14,It is $7.20 for a box of 4.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,15,"The tarts are baked at the premise, so they are fresh!"
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,16,So fresh that the staffs would make everyone who placed an order and paid to stand around and wait for the tarts to cool down a bit.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,17,That added to the increasing number of waiting patrons standing around.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,18,I definitely do not mind trying other pastries at Tai Cheong.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,19,So glad I can finally get Tai Cheong egg tarts here.
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,20,Now I just need to trek my way to Chinatown to get my hands on some Tong Heng egg tarts :D These two egg tarts have different crusts but both equally amazing!
cKqt0e_H_rb7quKPneMevA,21,!
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,0,"Once upon a time, thwarted by a devilishly long queue at Toast Box, a girl named Fats despaired and slinked over to Imperial Treasure Bakery to sniff dismissively at the goods on display."
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,1,"At first glance, they appeared common...the same old, same old Asian pastries With an air of beleaguered desperation and a long suffering sigh, she plucked a cheese and sausage pastry out of the display and settled up at the register."
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,2,"And it was at the magical moment of exchange, when she first felt the bagged pastry in her hot little hand, that the spell of enchantment was spun!"
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,3,Because the pastry was hot from the oven...and turned out to be extremely delicious!
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,4,(Even though sausage apparently means hot dog).
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,5,"For just $1-2 a pop, Imperial Treasure bakes up some amazing breads and pastries!"
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,6,"My favorite, affectionately termed by my colleagues as a donut for carnivores, is the polo cha siu bun ($1.80)."
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,7,"The bun is soft, chewy and slightly sweet, like Hawaiian sweet potato bread."
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,8,"Sugary pineapple streusel is baked into the top of the bun...and then...the piece de resistance...the bun is fulled with flavorful, fatty cha siu pork."
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,9,"Oh yeah, that baby is a killer, a sweet decadent killer."
VGzgAshJIMZDOgqeWZFDuA,10,PARTING THOUGHT: I am looking forward to trying the other pastries...if I can tear myself away from the magnificent polo cha siu bun!
KeiYSz5-6OFjKjdz2PpGYQ,0,Went to Central Mall to look for a bakery to grab some breakfast to go.
KeiYSz5-6OFjKjdz2PpGYQ,1,Found Crystal Jade My Bread with all its cute panda logos and was excited to show my German bf what yummy Asian breads are like.
KeiYSz5-6OFjKjdz2PpGYQ,2,"We settled on a baked pineapple bolo bun, baked Oreo mexican bun, steamed red bean paste bun, and baked chicken curry puff."
KeiYSz5-6OFjKjdz2PpGYQ,3,"Honestly, I was only familiar with the first and third choices, but it was a good chance to try something new."
KeiYSz5-6OFjKjdz2PpGYQ,4,":) The breads were light and sweet, and the puff was flaky and oily."
KeiYSz5-6OFjKjdz2PpGYQ,5,"Actually, all of it was pretty oily."
KeiYSz5-6OFjKjdz2PpGYQ,6,But it still made for a nice breakfast.
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,0,I've always been a fan of the Japanese food at Liang Court.
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,1,Tampopo Deli is no exception.
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,2,"This is my favourite place in Singapore to buy Japanese comfort food: bento boxes, ramen, udon."
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,3,They have EVERYTHING!
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,4,I think that's the beauty of this place.
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,5,"The food won't blow you away, but think high quality Japanese food court food."
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,6,So please temper your expectations!
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,7,I am a huge fan of the Tokyo Street Ramen for $11.50.
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,8,"It's a simple ramen, but tastes exactly what I remember from my various trips to Tokyo."
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,9,"The bentos boxes are solid, however, they are sitting out in the open and need to be heated."
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,10,"I dock one star because it's likely not fresh, it is a deli after all."
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,11,"Fortunately, the ramen and udon are made fresh, so no worries."
KL8w-8JURXFV86fg1XQ5EQ,12,"If you live or stay in the River Valley / Clarke Quay area and are craving Japanese comfort food, there is no place better than Tampopo Deli!"
IHIWT-gFuTZ8cBPIfDPGyg,0,"This KFC in Anchorpoint has a nice location in the mall, tucked away in the corner, so you can enjoy your chicken here in peace."
IHIWT-gFuTZ8cBPIfDPGyg,1,"There are always plenty of places to sit around, It's clean and the couches are comfortable."
IHIWT-gFuTZ8cBPIfDPGyg,2,The staff is friendly and the store looks clean in general.
IHIWT-gFuTZ8cBPIfDPGyg,3,"However since I saw Food Inc, I don't want to eat chicken anymore from fast food chains."
IHIWT-gFuTZ8cBPIfDPGyg,4,"Filled with hormones since birth, these chickens are never able to stand on their feet just to grow the meet as fast as possible."
IHIWT-gFuTZ8cBPIfDPGyg,5,The image of a guy filtering out the dead chicken from the other almost dead ones is still baked on my retinas.
IHIWT-gFuTZ8cBPIfDPGyg,6,Anyway this KFC is open daily daily : 11:00am to 10:00pm
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,0,WAFFLE ICE CREAM!
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,1,Who can resist good waffle ice cream??
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,2,I certainly cannot!!!
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,3,I didnt come here for dinner but only for dessert thus I can only comment about the 2 sets of awesome waffle ice cream I had here.
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,4,"Besides the lychee martini and really didnt taste anything like lychee martini (more like lychee only), the rest of the ice cream flavours hat we had were GREAT!"
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE the rum and raisin.
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,6,A little out of the way for those who dont drive cos its a slight trudge from the nearest Kovan mrt.
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,7,Parking is also challenging cos the options of parking at the private estate is not as convenient as parking near to the shop but lots are really limited.
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,8,"In any case, I LOVE THE ICE CREAM here!"
WFh34TKBnAdmE7ONyfXrig,9,!
ZxyZwquHela4SdYD4tkhaw,0,Nice environment (indoor or outdoor) for good food.
ZxyZwquHela4SdYD4tkhaw,1,Great hangout for large group and family as well.
ZxyZwquHela4SdYD4tkhaw,2,Best of all no service charge!
UH168cLoHMQevayF1dC43A,0,"Although I'm not a big fan of chocolate, Chocolate Origin's chocolate cake has won me over."
UH168cLoHMQevayF1dC43A,1,"In my opinion, they beat Awfully Chocolate easily as having the best chocolate cake in town."
UH168cLoHMQevayF1dC43A,2,"Its made true to its name, thick with rich chocolate, and glazed to absolute perfection."
UH168cLoHMQevayF1dC43A,3,"Its moist and velvety, and will keep for days if sealed well in a container and put in the fridge - so you can space out that indulgence, with the comfort of knowing that it will taste just as good."
UH168cLoHMQevayF1dC43A,4,Also love how you can make an order for the cake online on their website with just a few easy steps - and they even provide a tag for you to write your own msg on and stick on the cake!
UH168cLoHMQevayF1dC43A,5,Very cute :)
h7OGAEer6Hc2JrnUz6AZbA,0,"If you like Lava Cake with a scoop of ice cream on the side, then this Cuppa is for you!"
h7OGAEer6Hc2JrnUz6AZbA,1,It's as the name suggests = hot lava cake with molten centre + cold ice cream at the bottom.
h7OGAEer6Hc2JrnUz6AZbA,2,Awesomeness in a cup!
0U74wQ2a0jh8fTAGqrQrTw,0,This stall has been around for as long as I can remember.
0U74wQ2a0jh8fTAGqrQrTw,1,I need to have a bowl if I happen to be around the Malay Village.
0U74wQ2a0jh8fTAGqrQrTw,2,"Nowadays, other toppings like kidney beans, grass jelly cubes, creamed corn and even durian paste and vanilla ice cream have found their way into this dessert, but I still feel chendol tastes best at its simplest."
0U74wQ2a0jh8fTAGqrQrTw,3,"Just coconut milk, shaved ice, gula melaka, light green chendol and a dash of salt will cut it for me."
0U74wQ2a0jh8fTAGqrQrTw,4,It's made fresh each day and tastes so much better than the factory-made ones.
0U74wQ2a0jh8fTAGqrQrTw,5,"And yes, no red beans in their chendol!"
0U74wQ2a0jh8fTAGqrQrTw,6,The stall also sells chendol in cups if you are in a hurry and want to enjoy yours on the go.
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,0,I'm really such a fan of Ah Balling's peanut soup.
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,1,"I like the fact that the peanuts are extremely soft and thoroughly cooked, and in addition the soup is smells really good and is delicious."
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,2,I can drink tons of it and not feel full or bad about my body's sugar level.
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,3,"As for the glutinous rice balls, they have Black Sesame, Peanut, Red Bean, Yam Paste and Green Tea."
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,4,"To be honest, I have tasted glutinous rice balls that are equally tasty and those can be bought in local wet markets or supermarkets too."
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,5,So far I've tried a few flavours but I think I will stick to the peanut flavor.
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,6,The sesame flavor comes a close second.
5pZQ_DKOvQQS9oqvFAn-9A,7,"They also have branches in Chinatown, Nex, Golden Mile so far my experience is that their standard for the peanut soup is all very consistent, so feel free to visit any of the branches!"
P8AhPyCAsj-dbkCf5--oKA,0,Would be a lot better if they sticked with the clear ginger soup.
P8AhPyCAsj-dbkCf5--oKA,1,Otherwise a strong fan but looks like going down hill.
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,0,I remember a time where almost every 5 star hotel has a nice old school hotel bar.
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,1,"These days, most of them just have soulless coffee lounges."
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,2,"Other than the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel, there isnt many like that left."
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,3,"Fortunately, Victoria Bar at the InterContinental is still around."
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,4,"The bar is cosy and quiet, with sofas and arm chair sitting as well."
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,5,"Even though they have a large screen tv that shows sports, the volume is kept minimal."
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,6,"Drinks selection is also very extensive with over 30 beers, wines and whiskies."
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,7,The bar also makes very good cocktails.
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,8,"So all in all, you'll be spoilt for choice of tipper."
9mJz3MdoGGvr6BkPcgo4Jw,9,A perfect hideaway from the vibrant bustle of Bugis Junction to chill and relax.
V_jOO4c9hRAA7qIE_mSROg,0,A+ fun!
V_jOO4c9hRAA7qIE_mSROg,1,Great way to entertain kids and adults alike!
V_jOO4c9hRAA7qIE_mSROg,2,"Even walking around the restaurant is fun as you see people unleash their inner artists to create pancakes in shapes from mini pancakes to teddy bears to hello kitty to crabs and stars and much more... Each tube of batter $8.50 goes a long way... with two adults, we ordered two and a main course and wound up with the smaller half of both bottles left... Best to bring more people to maximize your ""art supplies""...ermh...I mean ingredients :) We got about six toppings from bacon to scallions to chocolate chips and bananas and we used just about all of it."
V_jOO4c9hRAA7qIE_mSROg,3,"On a comparative basis, the main course, country fried steak and eggs was rather disappointing."
V_jOO4c9hRAA7qIE_mSROg,4,"First, it was chicken, not steak (yes, Oklahoma, they butchered your state dish), and there were about two teaspoons of thin and rather flavorless gravy."
V_jOO4c9hRAA7qIE_mSROg,5,"If this is anything to go by, best to stick to the pancakes."
V_jOO4c9hRAA7qIE_mSROg,6,"PARTING THOUGHT: next time, we may get a chocolate batter to outline our beautiful pancake creations... Buttermilk and peanut butter, while tasty, were just too close in color..."
-IU7Yc-QBy2T2u53TxcKWA,0,"I would recommend this place to someone who has time, is creative (because circular pancakes are boring) and doesn't mind paying a bit of money."
-IU7Yc-QBy2T2u53TxcKWA,1,"The pancakes are good, the service is alright."
-IU7Yc-QBy2T2u53TxcKWA,2,"This particular one is right outside USS, so it's great for a late breakfast before entering the park."
1uyKW_MeThZtBzWXbKZvfw,0,Whenever I'm in the vicinity I craved to have a meal here whether it's for lunch or dinner or to takeaway.
1uyKW_MeThZtBzWXbKZvfw,1,"Good options of rice, roti, naan, and dishes but I always go for their Briyani rice with Tandoori chicken and Assam soup."
1uyKW_MeThZtBzWXbKZvfw,2,Sometime with Â hot masala tea.
1uyKW_MeThZtBzWXbKZvfw,3,All very well cooked and delicious.
1uyKW_MeThZtBzWXbKZvfw,4,A good meal in a nice comfortable and clean setting :-)
5wa0ilIwnAYyJhvxZKPfdA,0,The menu has limited choices for chicken delights despite the name of their shop.
5wa0ilIwnAYyJhvxZKPfdA,1,Their fried chicken cutlet taste like what you could get at KFC outlets.
5wa0ilIwnAYyJhvxZKPfdA,2,Yet their pricing easily doubles.
5wa0ilIwnAYyJhvxZKPfdA,3,Other dishes are sub par.
5wa0ilIwnAYyJhvxZKPfdA,4,"Overall, it was quite a let down."
5wa0ilIwnAYyJhvxZKPfdA,5,"Do note: I am not expecting restaurant standard food, just a decent meal for what I am paying."
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,0,There is always a long queue and my friend wondered what the hype was about.
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,1,The menu is quite extensive so it can be tricky to choose what to eat.
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,2,I had the glass noodles with braised pork.
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,3,The portion did not seem big at first but turned out to be satisfying.
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,4,I was surprised by how much I like the pork slices.
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,5,It was flavourful with the right amount of fat and taste.
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,6,The waiters did not serve water and we thought maybe it's an additional charge until we checked.
1WFv-1Mb-8RDeEPyidhHIw,7,Haha.
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,0,I'm surprised to find a local ice cream store near my place.
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,1,My aunt was the one who told me about it and that it was always packed at night.
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,2,"I like that the staff/owners are polite and patient with older customers, especially when they prefer to speak in dialect or mandarin."
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,3,"It has a more casual homely vibe here where ""everyone is a friend"" compared to those in the city area."
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,4,"While the decor is a bit hipster-ish, it does not give the sense of trying too hard."
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,5,"Water from a spigot (near the middle of the room), anyone?"
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,6,"As with many homegrown ice cream places where they concoct many different flavors, Lickers is no different."
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,7,"Besides ice cream and waffles, it also sells flavored soda water and light finger food snacks."
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,8,Somehow I like their version of a yuzu sorbet and Yakult Oreo.
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,9,They are light and refreshing.
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,10,Not too sweet or sour.
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,11,Pretty perfect for the hot weather.
rnSdRrymdkhK1XHPs2foJA,12,A scoop of ice cream starts from $3.50 which is a decent price for the neighborhood.
6OZS3XTIrBf8Nx9UyDxdEg,0,This is a small gelato stand near the food court.
6OZS3XTIrBf8Nx9UyDxdEg,1,The gelato is tasty and very similar to regular ice cream.
6OZS3XTIrBf8Nx9UyDxdEg,2,"However, they have a ton of interesting flavors, such as Ferrero Rocher and Snickers, in addition to traditional ice cream and fruit flavors."
6OZS3XTIrBf8Nx9UyDxdEg,3,"The dark chocolate Ferrero Rocher was very dense and decadent, bursting with chocolate flavor."
6OZS3XTIrBf8Nx9UyDxdEg,4,"Meanwhile, the Snickers was a little softer with subtle hints of caramel and peanut."
6OZS3XTIrBf8Nx9UyDxdEg,5,"The prices are a little higher than a typical ice cream shop, but not outrageous."
6OZS3XTIrBf8Nx9UyDxdEg,6,"Overall, it is a good place to stop by for a dessert snack, especially if you are interested in the unique flavors they offer."
DnkbGfjHZ-LWvIsQQEojqA,0,"This cake shop serves sugared bread in different forms, from pie-shaped to large crossaint-like pieces."
DnkbGfjHZ-LWvIsQQEojqA,1,The types that are encrusted with cheese are my favourite: you can crunch through the upper skin of the bread and smell the aroma of the cheese as you chew off the bread (which is fresh and of decent quality).
DnkbGfjHZ-LWvIsQQEojqA,2,"These tend to get snapped up before 10.30am, so do take note."
DnkbGfjHZ-LWvIsQQEojqA,3,"Other than sugared bread, the shop sells a variety of bread snacks similar to those found in Bread Talk, as well as entire cakes with themes suited for children."
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,0,Every neighbourhood NEEDS to have at least one bakery.
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,1,"Thankfully, Serangoon North homes a rather good one."
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,2,Plenty of childhood nibbles such as iced gems and wheel snacks are available here.
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,3,One of the best things about this bakery though is the waffle pancake!
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,4,"Soft, fluffy and moderately filled, these waffle pancakes are extremely popular among residents here."
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,5,My favourite filling has got to be the rich kaya and butter combination.
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,6,"The doughnuts there are also pretty soft, but run out really quickly especially when it comes to the rainbow sprinkled ones."
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,7,"Another highlight about this bakery is of course, its colourfully decorated cakes!"
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,8,Fruit and chocolate cakes are their main specialties.
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,9,This is ideal for last-minute birthday surprises or when you don't have the time to order a cake from more major bakeries.
72EDRpky14e31lmct0IYEA,10,"Also, remember to get your hands on their thick Blueberry cheese tarts (2 for $2) as well as Rum Ball ($0.80) and Cutey Mouse ($0.90), which are three of the most delicious pastries there in my opinion."
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,0,YUM.
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,1,I have been craving a good burger since arriving in Asia.
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,2,"This was SO juicy and delicious, I've already been back twice."
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,3,"Besides the burger, I've had the mozzarella sticks."
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,4,They were served with some salsa type dressing which did not do them justice.
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,5,I asked for a side of marinara (which they brought) and then they were perfect.
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,6,"While this review is based solely on the burger, I will say food at other tables looked great and people seemed to be cleaning their plates."
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,7,"Also, the service is very friendly and accommodating."
y3L18D_alg12P3Q49h38Ow,8,Can't wait for my next visit!
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,0,Bought a box of the new ThÃ© Noir tea infused chocolate cookies ($14 for a box of 10) for my friend who was meeting me for lunch at Japan Food Town and also a box of ironai cheese cookies/langue de chat au fromage ($12 for a box of 9) for my sister.
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,1,The staff was friendly.
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,2,I guess the pricing of the product is reasonable.
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,3,"LeTAO is supposedly famous for their cheesecake, specifically the Double Fromage made with imported Italian mascarpone cheese."
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,4,"Since they do not sell by slices, it would be too much for me to buy the whole cake and share with my mom."
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,5,So I have to pass.
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,6,Hopefully someone I know will get to try and let me know how it is.
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,7,LeTAO at Ion Orchard is the flagship store in Singapore.
S9DMjXvclfLiZnHg4j0QMQ,8,The stand alone counter is located at B1 right outside Lululemon or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
HViYtc-y3wMM9W9WoTzKNg,0,A very popular bakery when it first opened at Raffles Place with super long queues for their bakery items.
HViYtc-y3wMM9W9WoTzKNg,1,People used to buy their buns by the tens when they first started.
HViYtc-y3wMM9W9WoTzKNg,2,"But the fad has died down a bit, although you can still expect some queues to form especially during meal times."
HViYtc-y3wMM9W9WoTzKNg,3,"This branch is located in the middle of level 3 with a few other smaller bakery stalls, which is the same floor as NTUC Fairprice Xtra & Sushi Tei."
HViYtc-y3wMM9W9WoTzKNg,4,"Once items are sold out, you can expect to wait up to 1.5hrs for the next batch of buns to be ready."
HViYtc-y3wMM9W9WoTzKNg,5,Favourite items are: - raisin cream bun - mashed potato bun - liu sa bun
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,0,Baker Talent is a new bakery recently opened at Serangoon Central that boasts a long queue each time I pass by it.
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,1,I couldn't figure out what was so great about bread/buns so I decided to give it a go one evening.
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,2,"The queue, although undeniably long, moved quickly."
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,3,"I chose the Cranberry & Cheese, Bo Luo Bun and Butter Boom."
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,4,"They were having an opening promotion, selling the buns at unbelievably low prices - 90 cents for the Cranberry & Cheese, 60 cents for Butter Boom, 80 cents for Bo Luo Bun."
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,5,I was really impressed with the Cranberry & Cheese bun.
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,6,"It was so soft, full of cheesy goodness and light at the same time."
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,7,I'm not sure how that works.
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,8,The Butter Boom and the Bo Luo Bun were rather mediocre though.
q4sBiAu38K2tvtYDNY8bSA,9,"The best bit about Baker Talent is that they serve their buns warm, which is quite a rare find these days."
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,0,OMG!
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,1,Step aside Breadtalk and Four Leaves or any of the major chain bakeries on our island.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,2,Baker Talent has seriously awesome buns.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,3,I first chanced upon it a few weeks ago when I got off at the wrong bus stop.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,4,I was curious about it as there was a standee proclaiming $0.90 for the golden sand bun.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,5,"Now...golden sand did not sound very appealing to me as it did not tell me what was in it, and I was not about to go to the bakery and inquire."
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,6,"Fast forward a few days, a friend posted a picture of the golden sand on FB and it looked absolutely delicious."
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,7,Golden sand = salted egg yolk custard aka liu sha bao.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,8,Now I just had to make my way to Baker Talent to try it.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,9,I finally made it this morning and bought the Golden Sand bun and the original custard bun.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,10,"The Golden Sand bun is really to die for, especially if you are a big fan of salted egg yolk."
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,11,The bun was not that warm when I bought it.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,12,It was still pillow soft and encased a generous amount of the salted egg yolk which could dribble out if you are not careful.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,13,The salty sweet was just amazing.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,14,"For that I would rate it 5 stars, and the clincher was it only cost $0.90."
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,15,"In fact, all buns I saw was under a dollar."
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,16,The lowest price was $0.60 for the butter boom (I presume it to be butter bun).
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,17,The original custard bun ($0.80) was equally good but paled to the Golden Sand.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,18,Creamy custard inside the soft bun.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,19,A bit of caramelized crust in the center gave it a bit of oomph.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,20,I tasted some tartness and I could not make out where that came from.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,21,"No, the custard had not gone bad or turned sour."
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,22,It was like lemon juice dotted in a few spots.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,23,I would definitely return to try the other buns.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,24,And the cost of 2 buns here is less or equal to a bun in Breadtalk.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,25,A very good deal for breakfast or snack indeed.
8cdKfu86ss9xmUtt7izQ3A,26,NOTE: It is a corner shop just behind the bus stop.
AnfAMEY55890rC2k7aWmSQ,0,"My go-to place for various purposes: afternoon snack (plenty of kueh to choose from and the latest addition is mao shan wang durian ambon), western cakes (rich mango cake and rarer option of pandan cream cake) and gifts (pineapple tarts and almond cookies in fancy tins)."
AnfAMEY55890rC2k7aWmSQ,1,The pandan non-cream cake has just the right amount of flavour and texture.
AnfAMEY55890rC2k7aWmSQ,2,"If you have not tried this bakery yet, you should give it a shot at one of its several outlets across Singapore!"
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,0,"While strolling around the Japanese Food street (Shoktsu Ten) in Jurong Point, came across this bakery and there were quite a number of people coming in and out of this place that made me want to try."
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,1,The display cases had quite a number of dessert ranging from cakes to mochis to tarts.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,2,What caught me the most was the mochi with the macaron on top of it and it was the only one left so I decided to get it.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,3,"I also purchased green pumpkin bun (signature bake goods), chocolate bun and takoyaki bread."
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,4,The mochi was flavorful and the chewiness of the mochi was perfect when accompanied by the crunchiness of the top shell macaroon that was accompanied.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,5,There were a layer of cream in between too.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,6,I was glad that I managed to get two of my favorites together.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,7,The takoyaki bread tasted like takoyaki.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,8,The bread was fresh and the ingredients they used made it taste as if I'm getting an appetizer instead.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,9,This bakery uses quality flour that is imported from Japan but the prices of the bread was on the affordable range.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,10,"For the green pumpkin bun, when you bite into it, you can taste the green tea and after awhile you could taste the homemade purÃ©ed pumpkin."
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,11,Bread was soft and the taste lingers in my mouth for a bit after taking a bite.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,12,Will definitely come back for more desserts or baked goods.
KzKK4BllZy83hZSXNwpMvA,13,Make sure to drop by here if you are in Jurong Point.

iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,0,Ming Jia is another family korean restaurant and one of my regular hunts for affordable korean food.
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,1,"Situated in Bukit Timah Plaza, the restaurant itself is nothing fancy, with just the bare minimum furnishings and paper signs as their menus."
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,2,"The food on the other hand, is truly an authentic korean fare."
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,3,One of my favourite dishes is the beef bulgogi rice set.
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,4,"Unlike usual korean food stores that serve this on a hot plate, Ming Jia offers it as a stew in a bowl that is usually used to serve kimchi stew."
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,5,"The pieces of beef are left simmering in the stew, adding flavour to the thick broth."
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,6,"The beef is tender and a tad salty, but this is cancelled out once you eat it with the rice."
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,7,Another dish is the kimchi pancake.
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,8,"Packed full of vegetables and chilli, the pancake is crisp on the outer ends and soft and chewy towards to centre."
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,9,A special soy sauce is served together.
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,10,"The unique taste, somewhat like a cross between miso and soy sauce, brings out the kimchi flavour in the pancake."
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,11,Don't underestimate the portion size because it is extremely filling.
iL4eNhU4KYQ_moE6SH9_FQ,12,The good thing is you can request for a take-away box if you can't finish the dish.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,0,This is just the weirdest thing.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,1,After ordering I felt something was up.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,2,It didn't look promising.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,3,"Indeed, there are TWO Korean restaurants with the same name on the same floor."
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,4,I'd happened to walk past this one first.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,5,Ming Jia Korean Food is at B1-07/19 and is run by 3 Chinese ladies.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,6,It's like a hole-in-the-wall but without the amazing food to justify the spartan look.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,7,No Korean people eating there on a Sunday afternoon.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,8,One side dish.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,9,Ming Jia 2 Korean BBQ is at B1-55.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,10,It's run by Koreans and is a restaurant.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,11,Lots of Koreans inside.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,12,Seafood tofu soup ($9) - 1 star The soup itself was unremarkable.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,13,Not many ingredients - a couple of prawns and squid.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,14,But the deal breaker was the rice.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,15,I've never commented on white rice before.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,16,The rice was slightly undercooked and hard and tasted like cardboard.
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,17,Where's that fluffy fragrant rice that make us proud of being Asian?
HktQM3rW-MVhDpbN4j5tBQ,18,I've had better cheaper Korean food at Kopitiam.
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,0,Garrett's prides itself with selling gourmet popcorn.
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,1,"And it's definitely a store that can't be missed for everything you walk past it, you will get a whiff of the sweet scent of caramel drifting out of its store."
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,2,I always wonder how the employees can tolerate working in there all day as I'm sure eventually the scent of the caramel will stick to them eventually and make them feel a bit sick... well.. back to reviewing this place..
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,3,I love sweet things.. so it's only natural I ordered their sweet caramel .. but I also like cheese so I got a mixture with their cheese popcorn as well.
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,4,"The verdict was... the popcorn is definitely tastier than GV, Cathay and Shaw's combined."
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,5,Every bit of the popcorn was slathered with caramel.. making sure you know that what you paid for is what you get.
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,6,"The cheese popcorn though.. some I could barely taste the cheese, some the cheese taste was so strong.. it made me giddy with glee."
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,7,"However, the bad thing is... as this is popcorn... at some point, you'll feel a bit sick of eating it."
CeTr3fQp5OrL0CHJbT4aLw,8,So I guess it's alright to go down to Garrett's once in a blue to moon purchase some of their awesome popcorn... but after eating it.. you'll be put off from it until the next blue moon where you crave for it again...
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,0,I forgot how much I do like the popcorn from Garrett.
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,1,You will definitely smell the sweetness of the caramelized popcorn when walking past it.
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,2,There is no long queue here now that Garrett popcorn has several locations all over Singapore.
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,3,"For those who cannot make up their mind, the Chicago Mix is a good option to have both sweet and salty popcorn Caramelized and cheese corn are just so good that I want to lick my fingers."
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,4,They also do samples so you can request to try the various flavors before buying.
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,5,I find the caramelized (in all variations - nuts and plain) very sweet after a while so it may be best to share that with others.
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,6,"The small size is a good portion to share as a small snack unless you love popcorn and can finish it in one sitting, you will be better off getting the medium or large bag."
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,7,I do love the tins but the prices do not justify them I feel.
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,8,Over $15 for a quart tin of popcorn?
DuDTK2S2TrYazzeCcB4fPA,9,I think not.
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,0,Spoilt for choice here!
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,1,"Even after zooming-in exclusively to the 'thumbs up' options, I still had so much to consider."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,2,"It did seem evident, though, that they were to be known for their mango desserts, and no wonder."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,3,I picked the Coco Mango Mini Mochi with Vanilla/Green Tea Ice Cream ($6.90).
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,4,"I picked green tea, which seems a little odd but I thought that if they'd give that as an option, it can't be that bad."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,5,"True enough, it worked a treat!"
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,6,"The mini mochis were very chewy and starchy (as some would like it), but a bit too much for my liking."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,7,"They were also very generous with the number of mini mochis in the bowl, such that I ended up leaving some behind."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,8,"The best part of it was the mango cubs which were well sweet and very apparently fresh, leaving me wanting for so much more of that."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,9,"All in all a good dessert, chiefly won over by the mango."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,10,"My friend ordered the Mango Pomelo Sago, and while not being overly expressive about the dish, absolutely lauded the mango in hers as well."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,11,"I think one of the foundations of a good dessert shop is the freshness of its ingredients, and Honeymoon Dessert has certainly nailed that."
r7-ApZUFvXPnyiGLFuQ7_Q,12,I look forward to exploring the rest of the menu!
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,0,"Set in the same building as The Club boutique hotel, is pretty identifiable, with its clean and classic looking dÃ©cor."
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,1,My friends and I were there late one night and it was the one of the few stalls with desserts and cakes that stayed open past 10pm.
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,2,"Unfortunately for us, the cake selection available at that time of the night was pretty dismal."
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,3,I'm assuming most of their better cakes have been sold out during the day.
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,4,"I got a Passion fruit cheesecake and a nutty chocolate, both of which were average at best for me."
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,5,"The passion fruit cheesecake failed to show case the cheese, and it felt like I was eating a passion fruit cream pudding rather than a cheesecake."
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,6,"The nutty chocolate was slightly better as I liked that the sponge cake was flavourful and light, but once again, the mousse failed to deliver the nuttiness and chocolaty richness I was looking for."
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,7,I have heard great things about their rainbow cake and will be returning for it some time soon.
fkl9Vs0HgBtKkeiRZnLRMA,8,"As for the desserts in general, there are probably many other cafes around the area to get a good piece of cake."

TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,2,"Very simple place, clean, and tablecloths at 7 AM!"
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,3,Don't see that often.
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,4,"Basic menu, not a lot to choose."
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,5,"That said, I had Eggs Benedict consecutive mornings-a little slow opening on Friday morning, had to encourage her by showing her a wad of cash."
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,6,"(Strange how that always works) And, it was excellent!"
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,7,"Toasted English muffin, topped with perfectly done eggs, finished with spinach, salmon, and hollandaise."
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,8,Just perfectly prepared.
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,9,"Can't beat that, who would have known."
TcUTHBlxqn5X8BOdEy5Cjw,10,"With a beverage, it came to $20 Singapore dollars."

-lqn_b80nFyTU_TWEHMmXQ,4,It's like a mish-mash of traditional vs contemporary in a very compact shop.
-lqn_b80nFyTU_TWEHMmXQ,5,The deco is a little tacky with the posters of all the menu items plastered all over but I guess that the beauty of this type of neighbourhood shops.
-lqn_b80nFyTU_TWEHMmXQ,6,"The flow of customers is pretty regular with random seniors, youths and children streaming in and out."
-lqn_b80nFyTU_TWEHMmXQ,7,I only ordered the bean curd skin with Gingko nuts and it's pretty alright.
-lqn_b80nFyTU_TWEHMmXQ,8,Not too sweet and the serving is sufficient for me.

hNuuOw59oVvygar2PQRt_g,0,A quilt place hiding in the basement of busy United Square.
hNuuOw59oVvygar2PQRt_g,1,Good place for you to escape from the crowds of the mall.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,0,This is a cute little restaurant in the JCube mall.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,1,It is staffed by a few young people (perhaps owners?
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,2,"), who were very polite and friendly."
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,3,The service was good.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,4,The food was average for the most part.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,5,I tried the spaghetti and meatballs.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,6,The pasta was a bit tough and bland and the sauce lacked spices.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,7,"Yet, the meatballs had a nice, fresh flavor."
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,8,I also tried the macaroni and cheese.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,9,"It was rich and creamy in a homestyle baked format, but there were some dry and unsavory noodles on top."
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,10,The chili that came with the chili fries was the star of the show.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,11,It had a good peppery spice to it and would be good for a bowl itself if they serve it that way.
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,12,"Unfortunately, the prices are extremely high here, coming out to about $30 per person."
NPY4M7eFDZCIWf7zW-TBFA,13,"Although there is friendly service, the mediocre food does not come near to commanding such a price."

5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,2,Yes.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,3,We were THAT hungry.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,4,"Besides, the look of the cafÃ© was inviting enough for us."
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,5,It was quite pretty.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,6,"The skies were already getting dark outside, and I loved that the place wasn't glared with bright lightings."
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,7,It was dim and just right.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,8,"Like in every restaurant or cafÃ©, the first thing I check when I open the menus is the pricing..."
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,9,Very pricey!
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,10,"Nonetheless, we decided to just try the food."
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,11,We shared their Texan Fries since the staff was considerate enough to warn us that the portion will be large even for two people.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,12,The fries were good.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,13,Really good.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,14,"For desserts, I ordered the Ice Cream Profiterole."
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,15,Everything was nice except the ice-cream.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,16,It wasn't sweet enough.
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,17,"I've tasted countless of vanilla ice-cream, but this wasn't even creamy and sweet."
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,18,"My colleague who ordered their French Toast drizzled with salted caramel sauce also commented that the sauce tasted purely caramel, not salty."
5Zp6AOtR8eT8gkjap-CdZg,19,Not sure if this is one place I'd return to; even if the staffs are helpful and friendly.
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,0,"As someone who's eaten at Ginza Bairin near this outlet of Monster Curry, and at Coco Ichibanya at Somerset, I'd have to say that taste-wise Monster Curry does slightly lose out to both chains, but however offers more competitive prices at a slight discrepancy in the flavours of the actual curry."
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,1,"For example, I find that Ginza Bairin provides a more flavourful curry in which you can taste the different spices added in the curry, whereas at Monster Curry you really only taste a bit of chilli and its mostly salty."
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,2,"I assume it'll be spicier if I pick something more than Level 1, though."
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,3,"What attracts me to Monster Curry is the price, as its affordable, the prices range from $12 - $16 (If I am not wrong but its around this price range), and the soft drinks are $2 onwards, which I think is quite okay-priced especially since this is in the middle of Town."
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,4,"Taste-wise it can definitely take a leaf out of the books of its competitors, but nonetheless the actual curry is still rather yummy and the service is efficient."
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,5,"I visited the outlet at dinner time with a friend on a Monday, and between payment and being ushered to our table, it took no more than ten minutes before our food arrived, and I was reasonably happy with the efficiency."
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,6,The food portion is more or less okay.
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,7,"I mean, its just enough for me, but I definitely can comfortably eat a dessert without feeling too full."
i4Pj1K5rKi7FijXUzMTtIg,8,"If you are someone who likes larger portions then you might want to consider Coco Ichibanya or Ginza Bairin which does offer a slightly larger portion, and size upgrade options."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,0,"This up and coming new establishment is showing growing signs, Â very quickly growing signs that it desires to be the benchmark of what's good about Duxton hill."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,1,"Nestled away at a fabulous corner unit, Â Life is Beautiful (LIB) is gaining traction very quickly amongst expats and locals alike, Â all looking to enjoy themselves at a unique watering hole."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,2,"LIB serves up a dinner menu as well, Â and whilst I have heard great things about quality of food, Â I have not been able to savour their delectable treats yet."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,3,"Their manager is a close friend, Â and he boasts aplenty of their famous butter milk fried chicken, Â and if pictures are anything to go by I am sure it tastes heavenly."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,4,"I did however, Â have the pleasure of ending up there on Saturday night for a few drinks with friends."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,5,"Once dinner time is over, Â LIB bursts to life in the later part of the evenings where djs take centre stage, Â and Singapore's finest talents, Â sometimes guests from overseas, Â control the dance floor with their signature sounds."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,6,"LIB is a great place to unwind, Â let your hair down, have a drink or three, Â hell maybe even five, Â and dance your troubles away."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,7,There's ample seating as well if you want to rest your weary legs.
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,8,They have themed nights with a wide variety of musical genres on offer depending on the day of the week.
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,9,Their impartial attitude towards music is very appealing to me as a DJ.
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,10,"I give it 4 stars, Â of course to be updated in future once I've given their food menu a try, Â but their skilled bartenders and extensive selection of drinks, Â along with the fantastic atmosphere and general feel of the place are worthy of a positive review."
iSXxUuipxB2HrRa56a23rw,11,"Watch out Duxton Hill, Â Life is indeed Beautiful."
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,0,We decided to patronize this place while we were shopping at Causeway Point.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,1,The place has quite an interesting and inviting dÃ©cor.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,2,Our experience was also that the service was quite attentive.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,3,"We ordered the set meal, which came with the garlic bread, soup and drink."
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,4,We felt that the bread was just ok; it was very buttery but served at room temperature.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,5,"The soup tasted suspiciously like campbell's soup, but since I like campbell's soup, no complains here."
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,6,"For my main dish, I had the pacific dory, which consisted of two large slabs of grilled dory with herbs."
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,7,The dish also came with quite a bit of spaghetti and some salad.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,8,I found that the dory was quite nice.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,9,My friend has the Steak N Prawn which was rather cheap at $12.90.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,10,"He found that the prawns were not that succulent, or perhaps even somewhat not fresh."
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,11,The steak was pretty average from what I heard from him.
vcHfPel2rTigl38sx9HgIA,12,"Overall, this is a fairly decent place to have a meal at affordable prices."
X4jHR9vxWkhngBrgjErMhQ,0,The fact that it's a McDonald's makes liking the place in this day and age somewhat tawdry.
X4jHR9vxWkhngBrgjErMhQ,1,"Emerging from a McDonald's is not unlike being caught slinking out of a peep show, especially for the foodie desperately trying establish street cred."
X4jHR9vxWkhngBrgjErMhQ,2,"But honestly, people, snobbery aside, what's not to like about a large airy pavilion with outdoor seating that is well-ventilated and well-lit with the option of arctic air-conditioning if the weather gets hot and humid (as it sometimes gets in Singapore?!"
X4jHR9vxWkhngBrgjErMhQ,3,"), free wifi and access to food, drink and bathroom facilities?"
X4jHR9vxWkhngBrgjErMhQ,4,"Very little, I'm guessing, especially after a run, a romp in the park or in the middle of a busy day when a mini getaway is all you need."
X4jHR9vxWkhngBrgjErMhQ,5,"In this, McDonanld's has been very shrewd, and while one may sneer at the quality of the food and drink or even haughtily inquire if it is even food and drink, one Â cannot deny that this is a very well thought Â out and strategically located outlet."
X4jHR9vxWkhngBrgjErMhQ,6,It just happens to be a Â McDonad's.
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,0,I go through long periods when I don't go to Starbucks but now and then I return.
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,1,I'm most likely to go when I'm meeting someone and they want a sweet drink or we need a comfy couch chair to catchup over.
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,2,"I always explain to friends (or face it anyone who will listen) that there are 3 reasons I come to starbucks: 1) It's got this warm casual laidback atmosphere and because they look pretty generic inside, for that moment (especially on a work day) you could be anywhere else in Singapore..or as my friend said Milan."
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,3,I mostly pretend I'm in a shopping centre far away from the office or..the Pike Place Market location which admittedly is tiny.
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,4,2) They do good soy.
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,5,3) They do good flavoured syrup drinks for when you want something more like dessert or need to topup your brain food.
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,6,"They're pretty patient with my custom drinks requests here (usually things like reduce the syrup, short drinks, replace syrups with other flavours etc)!"
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,7,"Until the one time I ordered a non customised one, the barista making it actually checked with the cashier if he had heard right."
KCkvWfmyaNp2gF4JfuamwQ,8,"""Normal??"""
e_hI3ZLvLt-zQ6q031JCZw,0,"Red Mango serves fresh frozen yogurt, located at a small corner of Esplanade Xchange, the small 'shopping mall' at Esplanade MRT Station."
e_hI3ZLvLt-zQ6q031JCZw,1,"Compared to many frozen yogurt shops out there, Red Mango do stand out in certain ways."
e_hI3ZLvLt-zQ6q031JCZw,2,"Although the variety of flavours aren't that many for you to choose, they have a decent range of toppings and add-ons for you to choose from."
e_hI3ZLvLt-zQ6q031JCZw,3,"Also, I like how they have a small seating area where customers can sit down and enjoy their cold dessert."
e_hI3ZLvLt-zQ6q031JCZw,4,"In a hot country like Singapore, dining in with a cold, frozen yogurt is refreshing and really enjoyable."
e_hI3ZLvLt-zQ6q031JCZw,5,"Red Mango originated from Korea, so expect their large TV in their shop to play some Kpop-related videos."
fK5TAIeuZjmyjok2fGu07g,0,The last day for this outlet was 8 Dec 2017 before it converted to Yole the next day.
fK5TAIeuZjmyjok2fGu07g,1,"Although it was one of the last few outlets still offering llaollao, the queue was short."
fK5TAIeuZjmyjok2fGu07g,2,Certain toppings such as melon already ran out.

Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,0,You are sure to find something to suit your palate from their extensive variety available at Marble Slab Creamery.
Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,1,"Claiming to serve the 'freshest ice cream on earth', they sell a range of ice cream products like ice cream flavors, ice cream mix-in combinations, ice cream cakes, gourmet milk shakes, smoothies and ice cream floats, and even non fat yoghurt."
Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,2,"Craving something with a kick, I ordered a single scoop of Tiramisu."
Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,3,"The ice cream artist proceeded to mix my ice cream on a frozen marble slab, and then scooped it into a crispy waffle cone."
Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,4,"Marble Slab Creamery's rendition of this is with a hint of liquor, a touch of coffee and some chocolate."
Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,5,The ice cream came in a creamy sticky texture but the liquor taste was almost close to none.
Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,6,Prices for a single scoop start at $4.50 here which is pretty pricey.
Z4Yq6kqXogaSGSCw1e-_dg,7,"But the service staff at I12 Katong were patient and accommodating, allowing customers to sample many of their flavors before deciding on their purchase."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,0,"When I have my yogurt, sometimes I opt to go old school with the plain white yogurt, topped with fresh fruits."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,1,"Truly a refreshing experience, perfect for the Singapore weather."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,2,Yami yogurt offers a low-fat delight but is patronized by all.
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,3,"So obviously, there's nothing to be guilty about this dessert."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,4,"As I grow mature, I am leaning towards yogurt rather than ice cream."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,5,"It does make me feel lighter and maybe healthier, without the bloated feeling that ice cream gives me."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,6,"And nowadays, yogurt has branched out to a variety of flavors which expanded its market."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,7,"But with Yami, I go old school plain and natural plus fresh fruits."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,8,I'm not too sure but I'm not quite a big fan of their flavoured yogurts.
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,9,Maybe I haven't figured out the perfect blend.
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,10,I never thought I needed a technical mind when mixing toppings with flavoured yogurt.
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,11,"Although I would enjoy that, I'd prefer not to think much about something that's going to enter my stomach."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,12,"If you want a variety on your yogurt experience, Yami would be a perfect place for you to start."
fPSU2vf20SpO9vXmRYEavA,13,"But sometimes, going old school is more than enough."
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,0,Sho Teppan is a brand new dining concept that surfaced in 2009.
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,1,"What Sho Teppan attracts me is it allows customers to enjoy the thrill of cooking the meal themselves, just the way they like it."
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,2,Unique and creative.
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,3,Sho Teppan is the first to offer both Teppanyaki and Sukiyaki under one roof.
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,4,"Ranging from Wagyu Beef, Premium Black Angus, Kurobuta Pork Loin are the selection of meats that you can choose to cook with."
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,5,And they are definitely spoilt for choice here.
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,6,My favourite choice is their wagyu beef shabu shabu.
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,7,Thinly sliced premium beef dip with their sesame shabu shabu sauce makes it ultra delicious.
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,8,"However, the negative part is the portion is a bit too small for me."
0TXBPTQP4kRDYpBlUJi4kQ,9,"If they were to offer buffet style, I would definitely be camping there every day."
pE7b7Va0DG0azXjRqCKfnA,0,Decent quality food here but not as good as true Yakitori because it doesn't have that charcoal taste that you'll get at real yakitori houses.
pE7b7Va0DG0azXjRqCKfnA,1,"Still, it's pretty good if you're just craving chicken, beef or pork on a stick."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,0,The basement at Causeway Point is such a food haven now.
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,1,"After dinner at The Chicken Rice Shop, my friend and I felt like having a sinful dessert to end our meal."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,2,"Marble Slab Creamery is just next door, so it made things all the more convenient."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,3,"With so many flavours though, it was hard to decide."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,4,"(Okay, it's just the way many girls are."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,5,"If a guy likes something he sees in a shop, he buys it immediately."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,6,"When a girl goes out shopping, she has to consult ten friends before she parts with her money."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,7,I'm guilty of this too.)
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,8,"Sensing this, the friendly staff actually allowed us to sample some flavours."
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,9,We eventually went with the peach and lemon custard flavours and watched as the staff mixed the flavours with our chosen toppings on the marble slab.
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,10,The end result was both tart and creamy.
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,11,The service is not bad either.
52AjLryEnjrF8Ck3Q_RcKQ,12,"As we headed to the shop's dining area to enjoy our ice-cream, the staff offered us water too."
mgBybXKxuK3Lo1qpuYVECw,0,Haagen Daz in Holland V has been around as long as I can remember.
mgBybXKxuK3Lo1qpuYVECw,1,It recently went through a renovation and is a lot more bright and spacious.
mgBybXKxuK3Lo1qpuYVECw,2,"There is an outdoor and indoor seating, and you can eat in or take away."
mgBybXKxuK3Lo1qpuYVECw,3,Be aware though that eating in is about 20% more expensive than buying take away.
mgBybXKxuK3Lo1qpuYVECw,4,"Haagen Daz ice cream is always really good and although a bit more pricey, its worth it."
mgBybXKxuK3Lo1qpuYVECw,5,The chocolate and cookies and cream are my favorite.
mgBybXKxuK3Lo1qpuYVECw,6,It can get a bit crowded here during weekend nights.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,0,Worst service ever.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,1,"I've grown up in the states and Haagen Dazs first of all doesn't cost this much, and secondly the scoops are not this little."
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,2,The managers name is Katherine and had the worst attitude ever.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,3,She had plenty of empty tables.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,4,And we want to sit in the table that she claimed was for 7 people.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,5,"We are a group of 4, 2 moms and 2 daughters."
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,6,"""No you can't sit here this table is for 7 people."
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,7,"That's the rule."""
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,8,Can I speak to ur manager?
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,9,"""That's me in the manager and this is the rule."
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,10,"You can sit over there at the corner or at the other corner for 4 people."""
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,11,Well we don't want to sit in the table of 4 next to the bathroom or by the corner.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,12,"""No you can't because this table is for 7."""
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,13,What time do you close?
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,14,It's 10:30pm right now.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,15,"""We close at 11:30pm and it's already a busy time right now"" oh so that's why you have so many empty tables and Â only give us the shitty tables?"
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,16,The place isn't even nicely maintained.
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,17,"And now you're gonna give attitude to a paying client, 2 elderly clients spending family time with their daughters?"
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,18,"My friend says no we want this table, why can't you give us this table when you're closing in an hour and we are only going to be eating ice cream for goodness sake!"
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,19,Urg singapore service makes me so angry!
YZnTpKxlsOmIniSmjKqJTQ,20,Please learn some customer service manners because rule number 1: the customer is always right.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,0,This is situated along Changi Road.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,1,Parking is easy to find.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,2,I managed to find one right in front of the restaurant at 7 pm on a day before the weekend.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,3,There is ample seating outside under a big white tent.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,4,I sat and was promptly attended to by a server.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,5,He took my drink order with a smile.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,6,He was quite entertaining too.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,7,Quite cute.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,8,Lol This restaurant meets the niche where Chinese dishes are cooked by Muslim chefs.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,9,Let's me eat my Chinese food and let's my Malay friends eat without guilt.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,10,When all our friends arrived we ordered a few things.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,11,All were good.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,12,See pictures for description.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,13,I would definitely come here again whenever i have malay friends with me and i want to eat Chinese zhichar done halal.
IWwnHhCB-ANFKeCG7kDMCg,14,Great for everyone.
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,0,I can safely declare myself as a loyal member of Swensen's.
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,1,Due credits to my dearest Mum who feels most comfortable eating here (for some reason).
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,2,We've been a Swensen's regular for more than a decade.
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,3,One thing I feel is notable about them is their 85% consistency in food quality.
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,4,I've never had much complaints before.
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,5,"Of course there were times where I can definitely taste the difference between the Mac & Cheese at Tampines outlet, and the one at ION outlet."
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,6,"But as far as this Bedok's outlet goes, I felt whatever I've tasted have been to my satisfaction."
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,7,The space is regrettably quite small when compared to most of the other Swensens I've been to.
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,8,"It's located right at the corner of Level 1 near the escalators.., by the toilets."
9t-PSdnwprzQ4bRpDoRdWw,9,Yeah.
FmgFDUoc5sULwVYur2kqKg,0,Maybe it's this outlet.
FmgFDUoc5sULwVYur2kqKg,1,Been this twice and the service and food standard are not good.
FmgFDUoc5sULwVYur2kqKg,2,Their all time favourite chicken baked rice is not really nice at all.
FmgFDUoc5sULwVYur2kqKg,3,Disappointed.
FmgFDUoc5sULwVYur2kqKg,4,But their HOT U.S FRIES & DIP are not bad.
FmgFDUoc5sULwVYur2kqKg,5,"For me, I think mixing with the special chili sauce taste better then mixing with the mayonnaise."
FmgFDUoc5sULwVYur2kqKg,6,PESTO SALMON is also not really up to a standard I guess everyone will have their own views and likes.
_kUNYdM1a8RmfDKuOeiS_Q,0,At first glance it seemed like just another branch of Food Republic but I was pleasantly surprised to see the famous Ah Yat Kitchen as one of the stalls.
_kUNYdM1a8RmfDKuOeiS_Q,1,The abalone noodles cost only $8.80!
_kUNYdM1a8RmfDKuOeiS_Q,2,"The noodles were springy, the soup and gravy were tasty and the ingredients were fresh."
_kUNYdM1a8RmfDKuOeiS_Q,3,I had restaurant quality food in a food court and will certainly go back again.
_kUNYdM1a8RmfDKuOeiS_Q,4,The place was big with many seats and finding a nice spot was not difficult.
_kUNYdM1a8RmfDKuOeiS_Q,5,"My friends had usual food court items like chicken rice, bak chor mee and shrimp dumpling noodles but I think the star is really Ah Yat Kitchen."
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,0,"Was attracted to this stall by their dim sum rather than abalone noodles but was rather hungry and decided to order their abalone noodles which was promoted to be on a limited time offer at $5.50, u.p."
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,1,$8.80.
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,2,"However, upon ordering the noodles, I was charged $8.80."
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,3,Questioned the cashier and was told that the promotional item would have less abalone than the one charged at full price.
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,4,"While it is acceptable to me as I am not a big fan of abalone, it is not acceptable for them to advertise it as the same noodles without stating the difference."
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,5,This is misleading and unfair to customers.
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,6,The abalone noodles were not exceptional.
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,7,"While the Â thickened broth it were served in was somewhat flavourful, the noodles did not absorb the broth fully and I found myself reach for the chili more often than not."
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,8,"Then again, this may be due to personal preference."
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,9,"If you prefer something less strong, this would be just right."
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,10,The buns were average and not heated upon order but at room temperature.
e5y7aCRhSUXh0a3N-kXeRw,11,The filling was sufficient and decent if one were not picky.
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,0,"Most people come to this eating place for it's anchor tenant, Fei fei Wanton Mee."
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,1,"In my opinion, this Rojak stall that sits next to the 'star' of 64 Joo Chiat Place is one of the best Rojaks that I've eaten in the east side of Singapore."
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,2,"It's run by a single man, Mr Heng."
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,3,"I've enjoyed Mr Heng's rojak on many occasions and most of the time, he's always friendly and his Rojak is always top notch (unless of course, he's so busy, that he needs to be all business)."
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,4,"Most stalls tend to skive on making sure all the barbequed ingredients are crispy when they've got a long line but here,the Rojak is always barbequed to perfection."
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,5,I've never had a soggy Flour Fritter (you tiao) here!
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,6,I've tried many combinations and I find that the best tasting combination at this stall is to request for only fritters (you tiao) and the cuttlefish (without the cucumber and other stuff).
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,7,"This way, one can truly enjoy the crunch of this stall's patiently barbequed ingredients and savour the superbly mixed rojak sauce without vegetable juice and pineapple liquids getting in the way."
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,8,This is Singapore's delicious offering to rival salads from the west.
1PZfcWxQ8hyeq6OiIg8neQ,9,"Fei fei wanton mee orders could take a long time, in the mean time, I suggest you work up an appetite with a plate of Rojak."

FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,2,"At around 730pm, the place was packed."
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,3,there was a queue to place zichar orders.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,4,All the tables were occupied and you would've to wait quite a while for an empty table.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,5,"Even when we got a table, it took another 10-20 minutes before the table got cleared and cleaned."
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,6,"My recommendation is make a reservation, so that you have a clean table and the reserved tables are on the other side of the coffee shop which is more airy and windy."

FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,10,There were 5 of us and yes some pieces were miniscule and some were half the size of an iphone 6S.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,11,"The fish was decent, it wasn't MSG ladden as I didn't feel too thirsty after the meal."
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,12,The soup was served with vegetables and seaweed.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,13,I loved the seasweed.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,14,"The soup was refillable, but it is self-service."
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,15,2.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,16,Prawn Paste Chicken Their prawn paste chicken never fail to meet my expectations.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,17,I love them!
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,18,They are so crispy on the exterior and juicy and tender on the inside.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,19,They aren't too oily but they sure are sinful!
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,20,The chicken wings are also pretty plump.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,21,3.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,22,"Egg Fuyong The egg was pretty oily but they were generous with the ingredients, lots of prawns, carrots and some meat in the egg."
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,23,"The aroma of the egg was pleasant and even though we ordered a small portion, it was more than enough for the 5 of us."
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,24,4.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,25,Salted egg pork This was the only disappointing dish we ordered.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,26,The pork was dry and I could barely taste the salted egg.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,27,The salted egg was also barely visible on the pork.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,28,Skip this dish 5.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,29,Sambal Kang Kong This was drenched in oil!
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,30,I ended up washing the kang kong in a bowl of fish soup before eating it as there was just too much sambal oil on the vegetables.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,31,"For 5 of us, we paid $79, at $16 per pax, our tummies are filled with zi char food and we were all satisfied."
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,32,But I'll definitely go for sweet and sour pork rather than salted egg pork the next time round.
FanSIErWar1T65RwvMp6Ew,33,"Overall : don't expect any service, since you're not pay any service charge or GST, make a reservation before heading down, and do give the fish head steamboat a try."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,0,Hot Stones Steak & Seafood Restaurant used to be one of my go-to places for a great set lunch.
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,1,"Located at Clarke Quay, Hot Stones is one of the many restaurants offering Weekday Set Lunches at $15 nett."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,2,The sets range from 2 to 6 courses and are immense value for money compared to ala carte prices.
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,3,"However, while there is no denying Hot Stones still serves up a decent set lunch, it no longer entices me for the fact that standards of meat cuts, portion sizes, sides, service and even accompanying sauces have deteriorated over the years since I first visited the restaurant in 2007."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,4,"At Hot Stones, the Set Lunch ($15 nett) gets you 2 courses of soup/dessert of the day and a main of either Sashimi Grade Salmon, Australian Beef Sirloin or Chicken Breast."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,5,"A couple of years back, one could choose up to 2 options of main with more choices like Prawns and Kurobuta Pork, but the choices have been sadly whittled down."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,6,"The soup of the day was Mushroom Soup, accompanied by Toasted Garlic Bread."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,7,"This turned out to be the most enjoyable dish as it wasn't the typical canned-like Mushroom Soup, tasting more like it was homemade with wild mushroom and had a thick, creamy and woody flavour."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,8,"While the Beef was immensely disappointing due to the lack of marbling and the cut given (compared to what we have came to expect from Hot Stones from previous visits), the Salmon was still good, though it tasted better raw then cooked, perhaps from the lack of punch in the marinate."
bodSqjNRl0acnIuJIMEnIg,9,The meat and fish are served raw at Hot Stones and each table is given a hot cooking stone which will slowly cook the protein through.

38jLFaNGy3jkOgN7iQg3uw,0,Service was really slow and you constantly had to flag someone down.
38jLFaNGy3jkOgN7iQg3uw,1,Food was nice though and there was a wide variety.
38jLFaNGy3jkOgN7iQg3uw,2,If you ordered a main you got a free salad bar.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,0,Earle Swensen's -- Till date I still cannot understand why they have to separate the normal Swensen's to this 'atas' Swensen's.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,1,The prices are too costly.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,2,It's quite discomfiting knowing the same dishes at the 'normal' Swensens are priced at a much lower cost.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,3,I've eaten at this Vivo restaurant four times so far.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,4,Twice were treats by my boss.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,5,Hahaha!
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,6,And oh!
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,7,It's best you make advance reservations if you plan to eat in big groups.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,8,"Despite the high cost, this place can be pretty crowded even during a weekday."
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,9,I usually look forward to the salad bar whenever I come here.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,10,Those Ritz biscuits are a must have to add that extra crunch to your veggies.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,11,Even the diced up fruit salad is nice.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,12,I usually go with the traditional Thousand Island dressing with my salads.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,13,It's a bowl that is always there.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,14,"They have other dressings like mango-flavoured, honey mustard and etc."
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,15,"Coming to the main courses, I actually do not remember anything that is below $17."
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,16,Most of them were $20++ per plate.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,17,"I ordered the ""Tropical Hawaiian Baked Salmon""."
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,18,Nice...
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,19,The fish was baked and topped with cheese and pineapple.
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,20,"One of my colleagues ordered ""Earle's Poultry Combo""."
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,21,"As soon as her plate came, all of us were entranced."
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,22,"Me, ""Can she finish all that?"""
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,23,"It was definitely a 'poultry combo' as they put it; chicken sausages, chicken thigh slices, chicken breast, duck slices... and a big dollop of mashed potato."
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,24,Whoa!!
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,25,"We all concluded our meals with a molten lava cake, which was scrumptious!"
QdHEtwfuSmsaOyJ9a2sBow,26,A great dessert to compliment a heavy meal.
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,0,One of the famous seafood place in Mersing.
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,1,"Well, Mersing is well know for its beaches hence seafood there are quite famous and became one of the main attraction there."
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,2,"When there's too many seafood restaurants, people will going to get confuse in choosing one."
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,3,"Here it is, one of the affordable seafood restaurant that offer delicious menu."
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,4,The ambiance here is what it takes to get me longing and wishing to come back here some other time.
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,5,The calm and peaceful beaches is your loyal accompanist whist you're enjoying your meals.
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,6,"The windy and playful breeze, the skies when you sit at the outdoors seating, something to be treasured when you're spending time with you families or friends."
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,7,Quality time I must say.
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,8,"Anyhow, the parking is quite hard since this is a famous tourist spot and village area normally didn't cater much parking spaces."
efcUN4Mlc6bh7Jj6sR9kIQ,9,"Open from evening to midnight, this restaurant is suitable for early dinner and dinner."
smuq7A-BAmLewD_WOBaAgQ,0,One the best rojak ever!
smuq7A-BAmLewD_WOBaAgQ,1,"I love rojak, so I think I am justified to say that this uncle had the best balance of the prawn paste down pat."
smuq7A-BAmLewD_WOBaAgQ,2,The ingredients are well soaked and fresh!
smuq7A-BAmLewD_WOBaAgQ,3,"The sweetness is just right, the sauce is just right."
smuq7A-BAmLewD_WOBaAgQ,4,I forgot the photo.
smuq7A-BAmLewD_WOBaAgQ,5,But you need the palate not the photo to tell you this is good stuff.
smuq7A-BAmLewD_WOBaAgQ,6,Magic
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,0,"Lava Rock is a relatively more pricey version of Western food stalls you find in hawker centres, but it provides decent food at comparable prices found in pricier outlets like Aston's."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,1,"The stall sells various types of meat (chicken, beef, lamb) as well as seafood and pasta on hotplates."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,2,Each of the main dishes (priced between $8 and $15) comes with two side dishes.
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,3,"I once had a grilled lamb chop for $9: the meat was cooked pretty well, and more importantly, the texture of the lamb was sinewy rather than crumbly - a good sign that the stall doesn't use processed meat."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,4,"The sauce for the lamb chop is nothing outstanding, though decent."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,5,"I also once paid for a grilled dory with spaghetti bolognaise on a hotplate for about $9, and the fish was not only tender but fresh."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,6,"The spaghetti and the tomato sauce were average, but I felt that I had value for money for that meal."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,7,"As for the sides, you won't go wrong with french fries and mashed potatoes."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,8,The coleslaw and rice are forgettable.
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,9,The stall also sells calamari rings amongst a slew of hot and cold sides.
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,10,The variety of dishes offered at this small outlet is surprisingly wide.
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,11,"Overall, I would recommend you give it a try."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,12,"For me, the fact that you get relatively good quality meat for under $10, in a hawker centre with a laid-back atmosphere, is good enough for me to choose this over Aston's."
JzN4LOgYvM3e4c8cnh_x7g,13,Opening hours: 11am - 10pm
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,0,This is a very small stall on the outside of the 321 Clementi mall.
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,1,"It specializes in coconut ice cream with fruits, nuts, and other toppings."
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,2,You can get the base ice cream as normal or in soft serve.
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,3,"Additionally, there is normal and ""strong"" flavor, which is even stronger in coconut flavor."
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,4,The prices are comparable to other dessert places at about $6 per serving.
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,5,"I tried the strong flavor normal ice cream with peanuts, pineapple, and aloe jelly."
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,6,The ice cream is quite tasty and the peanuts were especially nice with it.
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,7,There are some nice touches as well.
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,8,The ice cream is served in a coconut shell with some remaining flesh that can be scrapped out and eaten.
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,9,You also get a side cup of coconut juice along with it.
4iJ_dV_KhW8E889H_U3bog,10,"Overall, it makes for a nice dessert option, especially if you like coconut."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,0,Not too nutty over this coconut Ice cream.
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,1,"So I finally got a chance to try the other ""authentic"" thai coconut ice cream outlet in Singapore (the other one being Pong at *scape)."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,2,After 2 previous attempts to try this place (they supposedly close at 10.00 pm but was closed when I got here at 9.45 pm the first time and ran out of ice cream the second time I was here at 9.15 pm.
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,3,Talk about bad first impressions).
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,4,"Today, I was here at 8.00 pm and all prepared to try the first ""authentic"" coconut ice cream open here."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,5,First impression?
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,6,Bad.
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,7,They ran out of coconut (the shell and fruit) and coconut water!
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,8,"Instead, they cut the prices by a dollar and served it to me in a plastic cup."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,9,"Secondly, the authenticity of the ice cream is as authentic as Justin Beiber's ability to sing (yes, you can tell that I really don't like him very much)."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,10,"First impressions aside, the ice cream itself was sub-standard."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,11,The texture was more sorbet-ish than it was an ice cream / gelato.
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,12,"Slightly icy, the ice cream was more frozen slush as compared to its rival and lacks that creamy rich coconut flavour."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,13,"While it comes with a wider variety of nuts (cashew, crushed peanuts and sun flower seeds), and a choice of red Ruby for that authentic thai experience, the key component falls short of expectations."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,14,"Overall, while it is edible, it isn't quite the authentic thai experience that it claims to be and the fact that they constantly run out of either the ice cream or the fruit just adds to the disappointment."
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,15,Lesson learned.
8TWN9ub0vy07e7tuwIVHJg,16,Good try but I'm sticking to Pong from now on.
TUWwaZ-DMRpu98X5xVlgSg,0,"You heard of ice cream mix-in, this place offer similar mix-in not for ice-cream but milk shake."
TUWwaZ-DMRpu98X5xVlgSg,1,"You don't have to stick to the traditional milkshake, you can create your own flavors."
TUWwaZ-DMRpu98X5xVlgSg,2,First you choose your the shake base and then you determine what are the mix-in that you want.
TUWwaZ-DMRpu98X5xVlgSg,3,"If you are not up for experimental flavors, you can pick from their signature shakes."
TUWwaZ-DMRpu98X5xVlgSg,4,One of my favorite is simply marshella (nutella and marshmallow mix-in)
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,0,Tucked in a tiny corner inside Jurong Safra is the only Ishi Mura Express in Singapore.
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,1,Just beside its Sakura Buffet big brother.
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,2,"For those of you who are not familiar with Ishi Mura, they belong to a chain of Japanese eateries and basically is a Japanese themed food court."
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,3,"Ishi Mura Express is more like a quick Japanese fast food joint, not dissimilar to Yoshinawa."
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,4,"In fact, you can also find plenty of these kind of small Japanese fast food style cafes in Japan."
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,5,"On the menu, you find your typical bento sets, don sets and even ramen."
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,6,"Food wise, it isnt fantastic."
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,7,"Price wise, as opposed to Sakura and Jack's Place and the now-defunct Hanis, its the cheapest option in Jurong Safra."
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,8,"The entire place, and its not very big, feels like a tacky and cheap Japanese cafe."
aHIQqyTyEMaHSfxmx1k5Gw,9,"Yet, like I said, its the cheapest option in Jurong Safra for a quick snack/meal."
s28qmMw9rAhxmGb4SEHNfA,0,"If you craving some roti prata, this is the place to stop by!"
s28qmMw9rAhxmGb4SEHNfA,1,The curries are delicious and the roti is nice and greasy!
s28qmMw9rAhxmGb4SEHNfA,2,"We got the cone thosai just because it would look fun in pictures, but I don't believe you could go wrong with what you pick from here!"
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,0,Indian Vegetarian is located next all the way at the back of the Comtech foodcourt on level 1 / basement / same level as the carpark.
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,1,"There are 2 Indian stalls at the Comtech, but this one is vegetarian and the other one is not."
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,2,That's about the only difference.
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,3,Plus this stall has a bit less choice.
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,4,"Not because it is Vegetarian, just because the stall is small."
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,5,Actually the people at this stall are also less friendly than the Andhra Curry.
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,6,Comtech has a large indian working population and they form around 30% of the diners at the foodcourt.
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,7,"Since there are only 2 stalls and Indians do like to eat Indian food, you can guess the queues are pretty long."
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,8,The line of Indian Vegetarian seem to move faster though.
n3XzXkuMdFqw_S9NFlup9w,9,Ok actually there's a lot of difference between the two stalls so make up your mind.
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,0,"There's a fine line between an exciting and interesting taste, and a taste that is just quite strange."
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,1,"Personally I found that the flavours here at Jollybelly try to be ambitiously adventurous, but fall short of producing the goods."
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,2,"I'm not about to slam this shop, I just didn't think it was what I wanted."
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,3,"Perhaps I expected a bit more of an egg tart experience, or at least a nice cream tart."
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,4,"There is cream at the bottom of each of these, but nothing very special."
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,5,"I know they do try, and it probably takes quite a good deal of effort to produce these little tarts, but the flavours like Apple Cheese and Longan Jelly tart just didn't work out very well for me."
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,6,"I imagine they'd be more welcome on a shallow tart, like those you see in functions."
AxO0boxKkqmveZ5nuF7eOA,7,"At $1.50 each though, perhaps you can give it a shot to make your own judgment!"
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,0,Reminds me of Honeyberry; a piece of home when I was traveling made it a little easier on me.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,1,I am an early riser.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,2,"I still woke up early to hit the gym, was the first to dine-in for breakfast at the hotel, and I walked around for an hour to explore."
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,3,I had that much time before having to head into work.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,4,Another serendipitous find.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,5,"I was walking and enjoying some quiet time to myself and then right before my eyes, I knew I would gain at least 2lbs from my purchase."
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,6,I bought the Cheesy Shrooms Pizza and the Chocolate Bomb.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,7,I ate both in the elevator whilst waiting to get to level 2M at work.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,8,My colleagues were amazed and disgusted w/ my appetite.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,9,I didn't care!
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,10,"A few days after my discovery, I bought a few for my team in Singapore."
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,11,"During my last week in Singapore, I came back again on a Saturday night for another Chocolate Bomb."
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,12,+ cheesy shrooms pizza is hella cheesy + chocolate bomb is THE BOMB Exactly like the roti bun at Honeyberry.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,13,"So light, airy, decadent, and a hint of chocolatey goodness."
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,14,I enjoyed every single bite.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,15,Damn.
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,16,I might need to visit Honeyberry soon!!
u4h84a50nnZRfHr136Pefw,17,!
jAr8zUuGS2NQuDNHJlV9bA,0,Yum!
jAr8zUuGS2NQuDNHJlV9bA,1,"Tasty little creme-filled donuts, and a ton of different flavors."
jAr8zUuGS2NQuDNHJlV9bA,2,"My friend and I got a sampler of 4 of these little guys, and it was a nice snack while exploring Singapore."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,0,"I've never found this that great, but people seem to love it, and it's the only proper dessert stall in Adam Road Food Centre, so I always find myself finishing off with this anyway."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,1,"Their tau suan comes in a very generous portion, with an equally generous helping of you tiao on the side, something which I hadn't even expected at all."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,2,Top marks to them for recognising that you should never have tau suan without the contrasting savouriness of a you tiao!
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,3,"I found the tau suan rather average, I got a little sick of how 'beany' it was, and I felt that the consistency of the tau suan went a little wrong after a while."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,4,"Then again I bought this almost at midnight, when it would probably have been wiser to get in the morning instead."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,5,"I was also fairly disappointed by their cheng tng, which has a decent soup, but their ingredients aren't very soft, and don't seem particularly fresh to me, so I never feel like finishing every bit of it."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,6,"I'm a sucker for the little sago pearls in cheng tngs, but this one has too little, and is a little too hard for my liking."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,7,"I've never tried their iced kacang, but it does look pretty decent (half of the excitement of iced kacang is in its appearance anyway!)."
u2BsQUgGOFx1kO5mW3El4g,8,Would love to hear how that goes!
ZbuyRKwAciqx-xNGODdoVA,0,Decent local dessert stall that sells pretty cheap but nice dessert.
ZbuyRKwAciqx-xNGODdoVA,1,I always enjoy coming here for either 'Ice Kachang' or 'Tau Suan' and they never disappoint.
ZbuyRKwAciqx-xNGODdoVA,2,"For a price of around $2, what's there to complain?"
ZbuyRKwAciqx-xNGODdoVA,3,It's value for money in fact.
ZbuyRKwAciqx-xNGODdoVA,4,"For the 'Tau Suan', I enjoy it because it is not too sweet yet tasty, perfect combination with the Chinese doughnut."
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,0,The Red Mango at Wilkie Edge is always quiet although occupying a big area.
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,1,Seats are always empty and I believe business is not that good.
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,2,But it is still a nice yogurt to have between breaks.
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,3,The store usually provides two flavours daily.
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,4,"One being the original plain yogurt and the other flavour is different every day ranging from Mango, Raspberry, etc."
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,5,"Because of the bad business at this location, the stores always has promotion during weekends and other occasions."
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,6,"The promotion is definitely worth it, which is 1-for-1."
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,7,I will always get myself one and share the promotion with my friend.
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,8,The store provide 3-4 tables for dine-in for customers to enjoy their yogurt at the place.
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,9,What I don't like is the lack of lights at the store sometimes when the spotlights are not on.
RhW-u0QhmKP_bfEjt6Bg9g,10,It gives a not energetic feel and doesnt go in line with the impression of yogurt.
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,0,"Whenever I am around Cineleisure and I am feeling peckish, Best Fries Forever will usually be the place where you will find me satisfying my hunger."
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,1,Why this place?
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,2,I mean it's nothing special right?
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,3,"There's fries at MacDonald's, KFC, Burger King etc."
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,4,"Because here, the fries are well, sliced with the potato skin on, deep fried and served in it's seemingly all natural oily goodness."
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,5,"But that's not all, it comes in several different 'flavours' ranging from plain to garlic dips to curry."
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,6,My boyfriend will usually take the Gusto Garlic flavour while I pick the Wow Wow West (Chilli beef and cheese) one.
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,7,"This time, I decided to be a little more adventurous and try the Friendly Fire ($4.70 for Large), which is some kind of spicy mayo tasting sauce generously sprinkled onto the fries."
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,8,"Thankfully, I topped up $1.50 Â for the Sjora drink because my tongue sadly, cannot tolerate the 'spiciness.'"
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,9,"All in all, Friendly Fire was not bad."
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,10,"It tastes sweet at first, then the spiciness kicks in a little bit Â later."
bIug_Z1V__e__UpYafS_8Q,11,"It's definitely the place to go if you are looking for a quick bite when you are feeling peckish in the afternoon or if you want, order the large and have it for a 'full' meal."
Z1DJt5hlwrRwphniyTNqJg,0,Local chocolate heaven with various mouth-watering desserts.
Z1DJt5hlwrRwphniyTNqJg,1,The price is a bit high but worth it for the quality and support of domestic brands.
Z1DJt5hlwrRwphniyTNqJg,2,I tried the flourless chocolate cake and chocolate truffles.
Z1DJt5hlwrRwphniyTNqJg,3,Thumbs up for both!
Z1DJt5hlwrRwphniyTNqJg,4,"True to its name, the cake is filled with pure chocolate instead of flour and the portion is just right to be satisfying but not overwhelming."
Z1DJt5hlwrRwphniyTNqJg,5,The truffles also have the right amount of richness and texture.
Z1DJt5hlwrRwphniyTNqJg,6,"To top it off, it comes in cute packaging!"
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,0,super stoked to try this but alas I was kinda disappointed.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,1,great concept but e toppings are an overkill.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,2,disclaimer: review is only referring to the customize magnum sticks not e plated desserts and food.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,3,I'll be back again to try that :) concept for getting e customized stick: 1. make payment at cashier $7.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,4,one stick w 3 toppings 2. pick your 3 toppings 3. select your dip (white or milk or dark choc) 4. select e drizzle (white or milk or dark choc) 5. watch e pleasure maker making your pleasure and putting e chocolate M to finish up 6. voila!
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,5,dig in!
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,6,reason why I gave it a two star is cause I think 3 toppings are too much for my taste.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,7,I Â didn't even finish e toppings.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,8,I guess I like e simplicity x creaminess x minimalistic of e original magnum.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,9,lesson learnt: too much of Â topping may not be a good thing says my inner glut.
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,10,pleasure maker?
hTnjJBaXsbpA9BRCe-jFaw,11,not so much
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,0,Everything With Fries (or EwF) was a pleasant discovery.
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,1,Pick six different flavours of fries when you order a main course.
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,2,I tried their lamb burger and it was delicious.. the fries?
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,3,It was not too bad... just that the amount served to you can be quite overwhelming.
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,4,"If you must know, do order their curry or garlic fries."
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,5,Their Nutella Tart is also not too bad.
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,6,"Just be warned though, all EwF stores do not charge the same."
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,7,"At Bugis, one meal (burger and fries minus the drink) can be around $15."
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,8,"At Orchard Central, it's $9.90 with the burger, fries and a cup of drink."
4CLUCTMIeDv57EiARWG-_A,9,"Of course, the lamb burger is not sold at the Orchard Central branch and so are some of their other dishes.. so do your research properly first before going down to any one of the EwF stores."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,0,"Everything With Fries - Where Eggs and Potatoes are the stars The name of the restaurant says it all, every main meal serve in this restaurant come with fries."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,1,"A refreshing concept from the founder of Awfully Chocolate, whom recently just open their third branch in Bugis Junction."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,2,"Thanks to our friend, Grace, the mother of a tiger baby who suggested this place for our makan session and catch up."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,3,"Located in the 4th floor of Bugis Junction, the same floor as the cinema, this restaurant concept is casual dining."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,4,"Basically, you won't miss it when you coming from the escalator."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,5,"Not sure on how the crowd was going to be that night, we arrived early and hungry."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,6,So we decided to order Skinny Wings ($6.90) Â first before our makan kakis arrived.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,7,"The skinny wings is crispy on the outside, well seasoned, and juicy on the inside."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,8,"Nice and yummy, I'll say."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,9,"Lucky thing they arrived when we only started on the nibble, if not I sure will gobbled all up."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,10,"Now for the actual meal, I ordered the Char-Grilled Char Siew ($15.90) and the Little Devil ordered the Steak n Tulang ($25.90) on the special menu."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,11,"By adding $3.50 each, we also get the famous The One Egg Soup and Lemon Tea drink."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,12,"For those that never been here before, the The One Egg Soup is a must try."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,13,"Look yellowish in colour, the soup taste is unique, creamy, full of flavour with a little tangy twist."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,14,"To top it up, it has the edges of the fried egg to add a different dimension in the texture."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,15,"Now for the fries that come with every meal, you have a choice of shoestring or straight cut fries with the following flavours: Original, curry, salt & vinegar, sour cream & onion; and garlic & herbs."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,16,"I tried the straight cut with curry, while the little devil get the shoestring fries with truffle oil as part of the special meal."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,17,The fries here sure did not disappoint.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,18,"My Char-Grilled Char Siew is tender, juicy and well marinated."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,19,The char-grilled add to the intensity of the flavour of the well braised pork belly.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,20,The garlic sauce is quite subtle and does not overpower the pork belly.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,21,"The serving is quite generous, especially on the fries portions unlike the mini portions of the salad."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,22,For Steak n Tulang (Bone) is more like the meal for the carnivore.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,23,"The serving is quite huge, compromising of steak, bone and fries that fill the plate to the brim."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,24,"The steak is tender and juicy, but slightly overcook."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,25,The bone marrow make a nice pairing with the meat and the fries.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,26,"It is so yummy, The Little Devil really clean the plate."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,27,Meanwhile our friend order the grilled pork chop ($13.90) and the cheese burger ($11.90).
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,28,"Unfortunately the pork chop is a little tough, while the sour cream fries is not crispy due to the sour cream coating."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,29,"The burger is tender and juicy, but the portion is slightly smaller compare to the other mains."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,30,"Since everyone quite stuffed with the mains, we decided to share the desserts."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,31,We reserved one slice of the mille crepe ($6.90) and Nutella Tart ($6.90).
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,32,"The mille crepe is made from layers of crepe, cream and maple syrup."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,33,"However, the difficult part is to find the balance between the moist crepes and freshness of the cream."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,34,"At a first glance, it actually looks very inviting."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,35,"However, after the first bite, you realise that the crepe is a little too thick and the cream was slightly solidified that make the cake to become more condensed instead of airy."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,36,"It is actually quite disappointing, considering the owner of this place made their name in patisserie."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,37,The Nutella Tart has a solid fillings and crust.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,38,"It is compact, thick and heavy."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,39,"The Nutella taste is also slightly off, seems different from the taste that you know."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,40,"Instead of finishing the meal on a high, the deserts was a let down."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,41,Service here is good.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,42,"The service staff here can easily be identified as they are wearing Â trendy pink shirts Overall, Everything with Fries brings an interesting dining concept with different flavour of their fries."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,43,The food taste good and from a price point it is easy on the pocket.
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,44,"We would not mind coming back for more, especially for the unique The One Egg Soup, however we won't expect to much on the desserts."
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,45,Cheers!!
p82xmvcJMtqf-JpgPeBZjQ,46,Food & Drink: 7/10 Value: 8/10 Service: 7/10 Ambiance: 7/10.

hjmX6KvX_OrfI4mRLVbLMA,0,Love the nutella crepe cake and the super burger.
hjmX6KvX_OrfI4mRLVbLMA,1,We ate at 2 in the afternoon and i was full till evening.
hjmX6KvX_OrfI4mRLVbLMA,2,The staff are super friendly too.
hjmX6KvX_OrfI4mRLVbLMA,3,Though the place is too busy because its next to a cinema.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,0,This time the place was nominated by Tim from the now defunct ALT foodie eam.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,1,The spirit lives on!
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,2,"This coffee shop resides in a sleepy HDB enclave of Commonwealth Drive, just about 10 minutes away from Two Chefs."
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,3,Why are all the good food in this area?
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,4,"The dish we visited the place to try out was the nondescript and underrated ""San Lao"" or samlo horfun only because it is such a simple dish of fish slices and white horfun with none of the sinful ingredients like lard and chili."
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,5,It is a good plate of horfun.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,6,Don't expect many dimensions of flavour though.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,7,It is just simply the taste of the fresh fish and the slightly burnt wok-hei taste of the horfun.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,8,The noodles were very smooth and not starchy/stuck together.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,9,"I am not sure why it takes ""3 hauls"" (the name) to make this horfun."
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,10,"I asked around and someone told me it's because there are only 3 ingredients: Fish, horfun and bean sprouts."
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,11,We also had 2 other dishes worth talking about.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,12,First - the rival to Two Chef's butter pork is Jufeng Garden's own rendition.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,13,It is VERY spicy.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,14,Be warned!
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,15,If you are a spice lover then this takes it right up to your league.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,16,"For me I felt that the pork is a bit dry and the spice just numbs my tongue a bit, but it is quite addictive."
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,17,My reactions towards spice is always like that - it kills me but I keep going back to it.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,18,Another cereal (asian bacon!)
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,19,dish gave us a pleasant surprise.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,20,The tofu was fresh and fried just nicely.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,21,The sprinkling of some hot fried cereal makes it an irresistible combination.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,22,Overall a simple and real tze char place to have some comfort food.
cYbXW8dzTJLVPqHsihc47Q,23,Prices are fair and if it is not so obscure I might go back there more often!
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,0,Local + is a small local restaurant at the second level of Alexandra Retail Centre.
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,1,Right outside of the entrance of the pedestrian bridge to the mrt.
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,2,It opens early and many have breakfast here.
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,3,"My stomach is not localized enough yet to have anything else but fruit, bread and yoghurt for breakfast so I only visit this place for lunch."
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,4,"Where all the other places in ARC have their peak hour between 1215 and 1330, this place strangely enough is only packed after 1pm."
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,5,Lot's of variety food from the local kitchen.
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,6,I'm usually going for the seafood hor fun.
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,7,The shrimps are a bit small but the veggies are fresh and crisp.
sHnuFm5G_VBH1UOSB_tIuA,8,Good value for money and local + definitely out performs it's closest competitor killeney.
szLumFlnhn8eHE3V-1qWYA,0,Get your Kaya on at Wang Cafe.
szLumFlnhn8eHE3V-1qWYA,1,It's open daily between 07:30 - 21:30.
szLumFlnhn8eHE3V-1qWYA,2,"There is always people eating something at this place, I have never seen it empty."
szLumFlnhn8eHE3V-1qWYA,3,"Many come here in the morning for the home-made kaya, toast bread, soft-boiled eggs and local coffee and tea."
szLumFlnhn8eHE3V-1qWYA,4,The Mee Siam taste authentic with lots of flavor and they also serve mee rebus and laksa throughout the day.
szLumFlnhn8eHE3V-1qWYA,5,"Sometimes I pick up an iced lemon tea after work on my way to the MRT, because it is right at the entrance of the pedestrian bridge to labrador park MRT."
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,0,"Came for breakfast, ordered the ""Rise and Shine""."
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,1,"The scrambled eggs were extremely dry and powdery, even McDonalds can do a better job at that."
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,2,"It was a halal certified place, so I have no idea what the ham was made of."
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,3,The French toast was okay but was pretty cold when I ate it.
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,4,"Service wise, the staff were unhelpful and cold, one seemed very new and uncertain of what she was supposed to do."
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,5,I observed plates taking at least half an hour to be cleared.
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,6,"Overall, food cmi (based on my sample of this one dish) and definitely not worth the money."
G7qGhI6puhmfWwVo0ixYaQ,7,Pretty quiet place to chill though.
rFHddSL3AXowWG1Nil2mqg,0,"Comfortable ambience, polite, friendly and thoughtful staffs make us feel at home."
rFHddSL3AXowWG1Nil2mqg,1,"I mentioned thoughtful, thoughtful in what way, the staff offered to warm up our chicken pies voluntarily."
rFHddSL3AXowWG1Nil2mqg,2,Plus the surrounding is clean and the prices of the food are reasonable.
rFHddSL3AXowWG1Nil2mqg,3,My mum and I had an enjoyable lunch dining today.
rFHddSL3AXowWG1Nil2mqg,4,"We ordered 2 sets of seafood croissants with mushroom soups n coffee & tea, they are yummylicious."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,0,"SS attempts to convey a cosy tavern feel with its heavily wooden furnishings, though the throngs cancel it out."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,1,"The menus are newspaper style, think House, and understandably manhandled and ratty."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,2,"Food choices are unfocused, with an entire page on breakfasts a la Wild Honey, an entire page on pizzas a la Skinny Pizza, and bizarrely, some ramen options too."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,3,"Luckily for SS, the kitchen executes its food well."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,4,"The sweet potato fries are yummy- crisp on the outside, mealy on the inside."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,5,Popcorn chicken constitutes even cuts of juicy thigh meat.
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,6,"Pizzas are a flat price for all choices, though if you want to go for half and half, there's an extra charge, which I don't understand, given that all pizzas are the same price to begin with."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,7,"For those who fancy Italian beers, SS carries Peroni, which isn't widely available elsewhere."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,8,"There's also draft Erdinger, which isn't too shabby."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,9,"Given that the the 3 for 2 offer is an all day affair, it certainly makes for (very) happy diners."
wSKGPLgRdLBv6GYfIGB_vQ,10,Maybe drinking at 10am is the social sin that's so aptly alluded to in the establishment's moniker?
j3GEgo4SskVUSIPPnZZpEA,0,"Lucky Dessert is a relatively new dessert shop to Jurong Point, having made its way to Singapore from Hong Kong."
j3GEgo4SskVUSIPPnZZpEA,1,"So you can pretty much expect to find a menu with desserts first made famous in Hong Kong, with specialties such as mango sago with pomelo or the snow ice topped with mango or durian puree."
j3GEgo4SskVUSIPPnZZpEA,2,"Other than cold desserts, you can also expect warm ones like papaya and white fungus and soy bean pudding."
j3GEgo4SskVUSIPPnZZpEA,3,"Here at Lucky Dessert, they present the bill right after the dessert arrives and you are expected to pay on the spot before you tuck into your dessert."
j3GEgo4SskVUSIPPnZZpEA,4,"I don't have a sweet tooth so I probably wouldn't frequent Lucky Dessert but I would say it's a good alternative to other dessert chains in Singapore, especially for those missing the famous Xu Liu Shan desserts in Hong Kong."
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,0,"In recent years, there has been a rising fad for froyo in Singapore."
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,1,"Froyo basically means frozen yoghurt, which has been touted as a healthier alternative to rich, creamy ice-cream."
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,2,"Without a doubt, this trend has especially attracted the female population."
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,3,Swirl Art is one of the chains of froyo stores that came out from this fad.
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,4,What is unique about Swirl Art is that you can DIY your froyo.
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,5,"Firstly, you can choose from eight to ten flavours of yoghurt."
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,6,The yoghurt is smooth and stays frozen for quite a good while.
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,7,You can also pick and fill up your cup with a huge variety of toppings.
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,8,It is so easy to get carried away.
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,9,"After mixing and matching your cup of yoghurt, you just bring it to the cashier who will weigh the cup for you and charge you by the weight."
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,10,"While a fun concept, what draws us to Froyo is the quality of the yoghurt."
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,11,The attendants at the store are cheerful and helpful and the whole place is decked out in cute colours - it is quite obvious who they are trying to appeal to.
QUozWPgfi5b3MEx4OBWv9w,12,I'm sold.
QAuDNICySCXbXK3Z5t3N6Q,0,Nice cookies but between $6.5-$9/100gm it's a bit on the steep side.
QAuDNICySCXbXK3Z5t3N6Q,1,You can always get a quick fix by getting a sample and breathe in all delicious aroma from the ovens in the back.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,0,Love the ambience it's always so relaxing to have your meal or dessert craving there.

xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,2,At times I really feel like ordering everything.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,3,I had a late night dinner on Friday night and I'm glad that they open till 1 am.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,4,I'm always there with friends for a coffee and some sweet pastry to ease my lonely night and the sweet pastry does do the little wonder.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,5,This cafe or restaurant it's split into 2 parts the outer area is more for cafe style and the inner area is more of a restaurant style.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,6,This time round we decided to have our dinner instead and we pick a seat inside.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,7,The place look so classy and I feel classy too even when I'm wearing a shorts ..... haha Foodie that we order: 1) Duck Confit $28 my all time favourite and it's a must to order food.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,8,The presentation of the duckie is good and it has a nice well crisp on the skin but the meat is alittle dry ..... don't really like it.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,9,2) Cajun Chicken $26 my friend cut me a slice of it and the meat is so tender and juicy.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,10,The fries taste good too the salt level is ok and it's crunchy and I like the way it is.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,11,3) Strawberry Shortcake $12 oh my this is the little sweety that perks my night up.

xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,16,The dinning experience was good and the manager Rebecca is very nice and give us recommendation on food and drinks.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,17,I personally love my mock tail straight no chaser.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,18,It's really refreshing and I love it.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,19,The menu is not extensive and we give our feedback as we feel that it would be a catch if they have more items on the menu.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,20,Rebecca replied that they will be adding more to the menu.
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,21,If you are there around next month September do pop over to checkout the new menu ...
xd6byR_P7HlNIhqcQ5xqoQ,22,I will be there too.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,0,Walked by and knew that I would be ordering something because I know myself so well.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,1,My colleagues also knew and laughed at me.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,2,As always.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,3,I wanted to purchase a few things and totally forgot that I could expense these so I bought a Nutella tart.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,4,The cost is $12 SGD / $8.63 USD.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,5,Still very pricey.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,6,I took this baby back to my hotel room and enjoyed it in bed.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,7,"The crust was a bit hard but after the initial bite, everything crumbled easier."
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,8,The Nutella mousse was absolutely decadent.
_EZFT9SAWoAVv89GN9yZgw,9,A treat after after dinner in peace was the best way to end the night.
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,0,"Canele Patisserie and Chocolaterie is one of the many eateries at Supertree Dining, located inside the newly launched Gardens By the Bay."
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,1,"If you are looking for some good desserts, why not head down and try some really good quality desserts at Canele!"
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,2,"From a wide variety of selection of desserts, choose your favourites from sweets, to chocolates, to macrons and even ice cream!"
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,3,"As the saying goes, there is always room for desserts, and in this case, you better leave much more space in your tummy if you want to taste the yummy sweet delights at Canele."
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,4,My recommendations would be the macrons and of course the caramel ice cream.
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,5,Macrons are one of my favourite desserts and these small sweet colourful delights just bring jot whenever I take a bit into it.
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,6,Even the colours attract my attention when it's on display at shops.
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,7,The caramel ice cream is to die-for.
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,8,"It can be quite sweet, so prepare a cup of water if you can't take it."
MmOUnUTxf1TLPycE_I6ssw,9,"Otherwise, it's so rich in flavour and the texture of the ice cream is so smooth, it's gonna be the best way to end your meal!"
YgtmkQhbBlFERceinfhSBg,0,"Half design workshop half cafe/bistro, this place is really for the yuppies and wannabe hipsters."
YgtmkQhbBlFERceinfhSBg,1,"They have great design aesthetic and philsophy though, taking over a two story colonial house and retrofitting it to be a light-filled open space with communal seating, couches, as well as outdoor tables."
YgtmkQhbBlFERceinfhSBg,2,Makes for some great modern photography.
YgtmkQhbBlFERceinfhSBg,3,"You definitely have to pay to be part of this upper echelon lifestyle though as a simple hot tea will cost about S$8, which is rather exorbitant."
YgtmkQhbBlFERceinfhSBg,4,"The food encompasses the fresh farm to table philosophy, but isn't particularly mind-blowing."
YgtmkQhbBlFERceinfhSBg,5,"If you're interested in some trendy photographs and some hipster experiences or you aren't very cost conscious, then go for it!"
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,0,Chicken Rice is located next to the Resh Fruit stall at the entrance / exit of the Comtech foodcourt on level 1 / basement / same level as the carpark.
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,1,"Don't be fooled by the long queues, they move super fast."
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,2,It's probably the fastest service you can experience at the Comtech Foodcourt.
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,3,"What I love most about this stall is that it is just decent chicken rice for $ 2,50."
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,4,The portions of chicken are not to be complained about.
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,5,The rice is full of chicken skin fat flavor.
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,6,The spicy sauce is balanced and delicious.
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,7,The dark sauce is as you expect it to be.
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,8,The staff is very friendly.
-bPKmWit68LEltpIv0RkTA,9,"Good job guys, keep it up!"
rpd4zIXZaYohBL7AJ5O4vQ,0,This place is fantastic!
rpd4zIXZaYohBL7AJ5O4vQ,1,"Never overly-crowded, its a great place to sit for a cup of tea and munch on a fresh you-tiao after getting groceries at the nearby supermarket."
rpd4zIXZaYohBL7AJ5O4vQ,2,"The teh and teh-c here is superb - the milk and tea perfectly balanced, and the Uncle who prepares the tea here seems to really understand what 'siu - dai (less sugar)' means."
rpd4zIXZaYohBL7AJ5O4vQ,3,Nothing irks me more than specifically asking for it to be less sugar and the server nodding their head but not bothering to reduce the sugar!
rpd4zIXZaYohBL7AJ5O4vQ,4,"The uncle and aunty (whom I assume are the owners) are very friendly, always striving to give their customers their best and consistently deliver."
rpd4zIXZaYohBL7AJ5O4vQ,5,Do ask for your you-tiao or butterfly etc to be heated up if you are taking it away but are planning to eat it soon.
rpd4zIXZaYohBL7AJ5O4vQ,6,If you're having it there though they will usually heat it up to ensure maximum 'crispiness' :D
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,0,Stumble onto this place on yahoo's write out on Singapore's 14 best Hainanese curry rice.
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,1,It's situated inside Pasir Panjang food centre store 41.
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,2,"Went there last week around 1.30pm, but was washing up to close...."
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,3,It opens from 4am (that's right 4am ) to 2pm.
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,4,"Today, I just managed to reach there at 12.45pm & taste their curry rice, but they ran out of pork chop..hiaz (probably most items sold out during the early hours of the morning)."
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,5,"Well, I guess this place is more for the people working the night shift in the area."
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,6,"So I ordered what they have left, fried egg, sotong, veg & pig trotter.....& ofcourse, lots of curry over my rice (looks really messy...haha), total $5.50 which was a good deal."
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,7,"The consistency of their curry is just right, not to thick or diluted."
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,8,Wish they had sambal chilli to blend into the dishes...that'll be yummy.
XAUfveSrr3BfZnT1PKQesQ,9,"Will be back soon to try their pork chop & curry fish, that's if I can reach before it's sold out."
zK5OGCsApkf0BNTvHvjwJA,0,The store is tiny and the service is friendly.
zK5OGCsApkf0BNTvHvjwJA,1,"The ""balls"" were al dente."
zK5OGCsApkf0BNTvHvjwJA,2,"It was tasty, lightly sweetened and chewy in a good way."
zK5OGCsApkf0BNTvHvjwJA,3,Love it and highly recommend this place !
VbgCzufmVRbZfHrJeiw3Bw,0,First time having churros so I haven't anything much to compare to but they were really good!
VbgCzufmVRbZfHrJeiw3Bw,1,"Exactly like I imagined, crispy, sticky and sweet."
VbgCzufmVRbZfHrJeiw3Bw,2,"The butterscotch sauce went well with the sugar and crunchy churros, which were served in a box folded from chicken rice paper."
VbgCzufmVRbZfHrJeiw3Bw,3,Thumbs up for the serivce-there was only one lady there and she was really polite and patient!
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,0,The roti prata at this stall is really inconsistent.
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,1,The first time I came here it was fantastic.
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,2,"I had a plain, a cheese and a bomb (boom) prata."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,3,They were sold as they were turned out (i.e.
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,4,they were fresh) and hadn't been sitting there for any length of time.
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,5,"So the prata were crispy with a good bite, and tasted clean without a doughy taste."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,6,The mutton curry meanwhile was thick and tasty.
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,7,"The bomb in particular was sweet, oily and dense."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,8,"However, the second time I came I just ordered plain prata, and they gave me some that had been sitting around for a while."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,9,"One piece was only slightly crispy, and was a bit tougher than when I'd had it fresh."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,10,"The other though was not crispy at all, and was stale and rubbery."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,11,"It was inedible, so I threw most of it away."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,12,Meanwhile the fish curry I tried was too heavy handed and they put too much curry powder inside.
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,13,"So if you can get the prata here fresh, do so."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,14,"If you see some sitting around, either order something special they'll need to make fresh or come back another day."
GWLeQTi6DX3PClhm9ZB9lw,15,"And you probably should order the mutton curry, not the fish."
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,0,Another one of those hidden gems in the middle of the heart lands that only those living in the neighbourhood would know about!
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,1,"Most Indian eating houses nowadays offer a wide variety of dishes, most of which are only subpar in quality, especially the pratas."
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,2,"Enaq's menu offers a wide but yet concise variety of different Indian dishes, more than enough to satisfy your palette."
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,3,"I ordered a plaster prata (prata with an egg, sunny side up), it was definitely one of the best I've tasted so far."
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,4,"A few places offer crispy prata, Enaq is one of the few."
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,5,The difference is that the prata here is a fine balance between crispy and soft!
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,6,Really a delight to consume.
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,7,"The curry served might be too little for some, but it was just enough for me."
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,8,"Another thing about the prata that differs from other places was that prata here is served with not only curry, but nasi lemak chilli as well, an interesting combination I must say."
yl0NUp_c2ozr_1rvAo3TlA,9,"The only downsides I would say is that the eating house is quite limited in seats, as well its closing timing at 12am."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,0,"This place is absolutely horrible - is what I want to tell people so the place doesn't get more crowded than it already is, but truthfully, it's my favourite prata place."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,1,You wouldn't believe how happy I am to have place that serves crispy prata in the west.
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,2,"The place seems to always be crowded, but the turn over rate is pretty fast and if you don't might sharing a table it really shouldn't be a problem."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,3,You might have to wait a little for your prata cause of how packed it is.
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,4,"I usually find myself at the tail end of my drink before my food comes, maybe that's why I get a drink after all."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,5,"I always get their teh tarik, and I highly recommended it, both hot and cold."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,6,"Foodwise, my go-tos are the kosong (plain), egg and cheese."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,7,"They are known for their milky gems prata which is filled with condense milk and m&ms, sounds like a delicious dessert combination, but it is pretty sweet."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,8,I've also heard they have a good plaster prata!
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,9,"Their curry isn't the usual fish curry, and is very flavourful, but compliments all good well."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,10,"They also give you chilli, which happened to be my first time using this as a condiment for prata, which also happens to work very well."
y6GLrmvGvG5-C-FAtN3LAQ,11,"Overall, amazing no frills prata place, that I guarantee you will leave happy with your food."
o4ViL7CDobHkRzA0bw_xZg,0,The food is pleasantly delicious.Shd try the Nasi Lemak in the morning..The briyani is a class too.
vhmLZkMcQ4oJck26dzrx-w,0,Great restaurant near Mustafa.
vhmLZkMcQ4oJck26dzrx-w,1,"Most lunch specials are about $10, which is quite reasonable."
vhmLZkMcQ4oJck26dzrx-w,2,They serve you papadums as an appetizer.
vhmLZkMcQ4oJck26dzrx-w,3,We tried: -roti prata with chicken currry: you can never go wrong with roti prata.
vhmLZkMcQ4oJck26dzrx-w,4,They did a great job.
vhmLZkMcQ4oJck26dzrx-w,5,"-fish curry with basamati: delicious, not too spicy -mango lassi: delicious Overall, a great restaurant with good AC."
vhmLZkMcQ4oJck26dzrx-w,6,It was quite popular during lunch time too.
3QJ2I5WtNFeMrqvSScAJdg,0,Men Men Don Don is a little food kiosk that is conveniently located at the first floor of White Sands.
3QJ2I5WtNFeMrqvSScAJdg,1,"This is where you can get a quick takeout of Japanese food, such as ramen, sushi and oyako don."
3QJ2I5WtNFeMrqvSScAJdg,2,"The taste of the food that you can get from here is quite disappointing, although the prices are relatively cheaper than getting a takeout from the restaurants."
3QJ2I5WtNFeMrqvSScAJdg,3,"Nothing else is really praise-worthy or worth mentioning... Well, overall just very average."
ZLDpwUoAxhfwvm47YZAbkA,0,I had to pop by Men Men Don Don when to grab a quick bite before I booked into camp while I was in army.
ZLDpwUoAxhfwvm47YZAbkA,1,Its a rather basic japanese eatery with your run of the mill dishes like udon and rice.
ZLDpwUoAxhfwvm47YZAbkA,2,Its one of the more affordable places so dont expect world class food over here.
ZLDpwUoAxhfwvm47YZAbkA,3,But I guess its okay considering how much you're paying for a meal.
ZLDpwUoAxhfwvm47YZAbkA,4,THey've also got a takeout sushi section for quick bites on the go.
ZLDpwUoAxhfwvm47YZAbkA,5,Decent place.
zPxNSCUpCPPaOzqFaDnHog,0,The buns are so delicious and reasonably priced!
zPxNSCUpCPPaOzqFaDnHog,1,Must go!
zPxNSCUpCPPaOzqFaDnHog,2,Ive tried their custard buns and really like it.
zPxNSCUpCPPaOzqFaDnHog,3,The staff are friendly and the prices are reasonable for a location in town.
zPxNSCUpCPPaOzqFaDnHog,4,A quick snack stop if you are rushing.
zPxNSCUpCPPaOzqFaDnHog,5,"It faces the road near a bus stop, so you can't miss."
zPxNSCUpCPPaOzqFaDnHog,6,Enjoy!
EeQOPg0iSxB_hcXnR72LTg,0,The buns are freshly baked in the morning so soft and warm..
EeQOPg0iSxB_hcXnR72LTg,1,"If you are there before 9am, go to the baking tray to see what you want."
EeQOPg0iSxB_hcXnR72LTg,2,My guilty pleasure is the luncheon meat with egg bun!
EeQOPg0iSxB_hcXnR72LTg,3,Yummy and it costs $1.50.
EeQOPg0iSxB_hcXnR72LTg,4,Sandwiches are freshly made and costs $2.50.
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,0,"Located near Kovan mrt, the place is not very well known but the food there is nice and cheap."
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,1,"Once you step in, the aroma of the coffee and slightly charred bread reaches your nose."
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,2,The spreads on the bread are also generously given spread to all 4 corners of the toast.
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,3,"There are a few types of bread that you can choose from soft bun, the normal bread and French toast."
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,4,All can be eaten in its original state or toasted.
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,5,They also serve the hong kong style hot lemon tea which is rarely found in Singapore.
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,6,If you are looking for a good and affordable breakfast or tea break this would be a place to try out.
gqVRESh9QuczP5VR-D7nRA,7,Nostalgic feeling with the decor to distress as well.
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,0,"Was excited for traditional bread - according to Straits Times (I think it was Sunday Lifestyle), this is one of remaining eight bakeries in Singapore which still make bread the traditional way."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,1,"soshiok.com/article/21574 Anyway, there wasn't a ton of bread left, I would've liked to try their normal buns but they only had coconut and curry chicken left, which I'm not such a fan of."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,2,Curry chicken with bread (or rice) - $5.80.
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,3,Came with barley drink (which had lots of barley seeds inside).
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,4,The curry was oh so decadently rich!
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,5,I bet there was a ton of coconut milk.
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,6,I also bet their laksa would be pretty good.
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,7,"Anyway, the chicken itself was so-so, not as tender as I would've liked - a little tough, actually."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,8,Potato was done well though!
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,9,3 large slices of toasted baguette - Â the crisp from toasting was good!
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,10,"But the bread itself was so-so also, I thought."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,11,"At least, texture-wise they definitely can't match up to baguettes in France.. Haha."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,12,Perhaps that's too high a standard to hold them to.
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,13,A square loaf of pandan bread costs $1.70!
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,14,Smelt pretty good.
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,15,Fluffy bread!!
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,16,"The lady was also really nice and let me exchange it later on (mom told me we needed more bread at home, so wanted a larger loaf)."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,17,"So, I went on my merry way home armed with a larger (rectangular) loaf of pink and yellow coloured bread."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,18,"We shall see how fluffy it is tomorrow morning.. Update -- colourful bread was fairly fluffy, not so airy that it was insubstantial, but just nice."
PZrYwvPA8wBjDIkj13hHAQ,19,Not mind blowingly amazing but pretty good stuff!
PYvYk0uW47KTHCw6yBC5lw,0,A very traditional bakery tucked in the clementi distreet.
PYvYk0uW47KTHCw6yBC5lw,1,It's olden looking brown shelves had caught my attention as I walked passed the shop after my breakfast.
PYvYk0uW47KTHCw6yBC5lw,2,"Where most franchises are selling at $1.50 each, Emerald bakery offers them at a attractive pricing as most of the items cost not more than a dollar."
PYvYk0uW47KTHCw6yBC5lw,3,Custard Bun costs $0.80 and was surprisingly good.
PYvYk0uW47KTHCw6yBC5lw,4,It's custard was pure and not creamy as I would have expected.
PYvYk0uW47KTHCw6yBC5lw,5,The bright yellow custard was stuffed into the fluffy and soft roll.
PYvYk0uW47KTHCw6yBC5lw,6,Totally well worth it's money.
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,0,"The croissant here I had in the morning was buttery, flaky and simply delicious!"
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,1,"At $2.80, it was absolutely worth every cent."
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,2,It went really well with the latte I ordered.
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,3,"For $3.80, it was pretty decent and was nice and smooth."
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,4,"Being extremely hungry, I had something else and I'm glad I did."
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,5,Their pain au chocolate was awesome!
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,6,"Although I'd personally like a bit more chocolate (I mean, who doesn't?"
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,7,"), it hit the right spot."
D-9CRoYsRD4QRKlASeQzCQ,8,Will be coming back again.
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,0,I totally forgot about the existence of this place until I was looking through Ngee An City's directory.
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,1,"I decided to go there for lunch and to my surprise, it's not even half filled though it's almost 1pm."
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,2,we were quickly seated by the friendly host and orders for the 1 for 1 lunch deal (comes with soup of the day) was taken.
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,3,"Less than 10 mins, the first of our 2 main courses was served but without the soup."
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,4,that quickly was rectified after they realized it missing.
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,5,"The food itself was fine, nothing much to be excited about."
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,6,The chicken breast Amatriciana and shellfish pasta was good in portion but not too yummy in taste - perhaps because it wasn't too hot when served.
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,7,The seafood baked rice looked promising.
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,8,"Sadly, it wasn't to my coworker's liking as it had way too much cheese on it."
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,9,"If you love cheese, maybe you would think different."
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,10,we paid $15 each for this meal.
WkbdghpTeZH4EYGNzindJA,11,i guess it's decent for a meal in orchard.
Pn-JErN7b-0zspIiuvVs-g,0,Right smack on Serangoon Road with the Broadway Hotel Bus Stop right in front.
Pn-JErN7b-0zspIiuvVs-g,1,This place is great for people watching but the food was just average.
Pn-JErN7b-0zspIiuvVs-g,2,The menu and sign says they serve authentic Nepalese & Indian cuisine.
Pn-JErN7b-0zspIiuvVs-g,3,Menu is extensive and has something for the veg and non-veg diners.
Pn-JErN7b-0zspIiuvVs-g,4,Really nice table servers and always looking out for a wave of a hand for anything you need.
Pn-JErN7b-0zspIiuvVs-g,5,Sunday streets can be quite crowded.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,0,"Not touristy, which is a good thing."
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,1,No frills.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,2,"In fact, the staff seemed indifferent to our patronage."
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,3,We went around 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,4,It was not very busy and the customers all seemed to be locals.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,5,"Many menu options were not available, such as the chicken tandoori."
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,6,"Not sure if it was because we went after the lunch rush, if there was one, or if they just don't regularly carry all the ingredients to make the menu items."
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,7,We ordered the curry fish and fried chicken.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,8,The portions for each dish are just right for one person.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,9,Both come with roti and were genuinely good.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,10,The curry fish came in a rich spicy broth that had a good flavor.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,11,We ordered mango lassi to wash it all down.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,12,The lassi was rich and had a slightly salty flavor that balanced out the sweetness of the mango.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,13,It was a good compliment to the curry fish.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,14,Overall the appeal of this place is that it is not a tourist trap.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,15,Nobody is trying to woo you and there are no stereotypical dishes catering to foreigners.
1vqiL34aPCBODP0VBfyb-w,16,It is just simple good food with no frills.
Sbdg0u1IQbBrXFyb9dtiBw,0,We just moved to the neighborhood and discovered this place on our way to the post office a few weeks ago.
Sbdg0u1IQbBrXFyb9dtiBw,1,This shop sells both southern and northern Indian food.
Sbdg0u1IQbBrXFyb9dtiBw,2,"We have tried the briyani, dosa, and pratas so far and enjoyed them all."
Sbdg0u1IQbBrXFyb9dtiBw,3,Even the teh is very flavorful.
Sbdg0u1IQbBrXFyb9dtiBw,4,Looking forward to coming back soon to try the other dishes.
-trphHecGcbwI4kBdkg--Q,0,Cake Magic is a halal certified bakery selling all sorts of bread and cakes that you can typically find in a local neighbourhood bakery.
-trphHecGcbwI4kBdkg--Q,1,They also have a waffles station where you can choose a few different toppings for your waffles.
-trphHecGcbwI4kBdkg--Q,2,The only thing I go to Cake Magic to buy is their french loaves.
-trphHecGcbwI4kBdkg--Q,3,"While it does not taste like the baguettes you get in most Western countries, this kind of french loaf is the traditional South East Asian kind which well with curries rather than jams or cheese."
-trphHecGcbwI4kBdkg--Q,4,I love to buy it when it is fresh out of the oven and the insides are warm and soft while the outside is hard and crispy.
-trphHecGcbwI4kBdkg--Q,5,"On weekends, their french loaves sell like hotcakes, so get it fast."
-trphHecGcbwI4kBdkg--Q,6,They come out twice a day: around 8am-9am in the morning and 4pm in the afternoon.
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,0,"If you're an early riser (I'm talking 6am-ish) and need some warm freshly-baked bread to fill your stomach, rest assured than Q Bread is ready for you!"
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,1,"It opens really early, and the delicious smells wafting out of the shop is simply irresistible."
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,2,Early commuters at the nearby bus stop will almost definitely stop by to buy something to chew on.
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,3,"The selection of bread and cakes isn't huge, but it's not small either."
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,4,"You'll find the floss buns made famous by BreadTalk, little pizza-like things, hot dog buns, and more."
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,5,They also make waffles and bubble tea on the spot for those greedy moments.
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,6,"It's definitely not at the level of Koi or Gong Cha, but you don't really have a choice in this area!"
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,7,"Also, there's a selection of those bigger cakes for special occasions such as birthdays."
1sgkv_E1IcPDHX82DcZKXw,8,"Nothing fancy, but they look and taste decent."
2DoZj7zGgjtuJRCdlKUnMw,0,5 stars for a great nasi lemak meal especially in the mall setting where decent food can be hard to come by due to the high rent!
2DoZj7zGgjtuJRCdlKUnMw,1,"The 2 basics, light n fluffy basmati rice and the sambal chilli with kick, are excellent as well as most of the other sides/ingredients offered."
2DoZj7zGgjtuJRCdlKUnMw,2,"Of particular mention is the bergedil (Malay style potato cutlet), always a good addon to go with this meal."
2DoZj7zGgjtuJRCdlKUnMw,3,"The teh tarik hot drink is also great, rich and flavoursome."
2DoZj7zGgjtuJRCdlKUnMw,4,My only dislike is the extensive use of disposable ware including paper cup for hot drinks.
2DoZj7zGgjtuJRCdlKUnMw,5,"Sadly many other places are similar but I'm hopeful that the reusable wares are making their way back as more recent studies are saying it's much greener, safer n economical to use the proper food wares whether they are made of stainless steel, wood, or bamboo :-)"
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,0,Pretty decent Nasi lemak.
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,1,"Rice is very hot which is good, although I found it a little dry and not as fragrant as other places."
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,2,The sambal was rich and they gave you plenty of it which is a bonus!
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,3,"No peanuts, but loads of ikan billis on this plate (which is disposable plastic unfortunately)."
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,4,"Fish cutlet was very standard and a bit cold and the Otah Otah was small and a little bland, but passes as the texture was great with it still being moist."
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,5,Very friendly staff who are up for a chat and obviously love what they do which is always a pleasure to see.
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,6,They have a small seating area which I imagine will fill up quickly during the peak periods.
_xzdbLy2WjEksTyQMkQY_g,7,"Good place to have reasonably priced Nasi Lemak in a mall, albeit a little more than a hawker centre."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,0,There are too many cafes and not enough bakeries in Singapore!
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,1,"Luckily for us, Swirls Bake Shop opened up at the very trendy neighbourhood of Rodyk Street which is very near to Kith cafe and Toby's Estate."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,2,"Serving up cupcakes in various shapes, flavours, sizes and colors, Swirls Bake Shop was opened up by a charming couple who decided to start a business together."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,3,Very brave I must say.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,4,The lady boss came from a fashion background so the shop had design influences from that.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,5,They then embarked on a cupcake tour of USA to taste all the cupcakes for RESEARCH purposes.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,6,Isn't that fun?
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,7,"They specialized in tasting red velvet cupcakes as well, which is coincidentally my favorite."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,8,I heard mixed reviews about Swirls.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,9,"Some say good, some say bad."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,10,"Timeout magazine said it was ""possibly the best-tasting cupcakes we've ever had""."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,11,It is quite a small but cozy space that is divided into the kitchen and the shopfront.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,12,"There are 4 chairs inside along a small counter, and more chairs outside."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,13,All the cupcakes sold do not have swirly icing which is ironic since the shop is called Swirls.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,14,We found that that is because the icing is 'handswirled' with a flat knife instead of piped from a bag.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,15,That's why every cupcake is unique.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,16,Well.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,17,The taste testing around all of the States did not go to waste.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,18,I tried the Red Velvet and found that it was really delicious!
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,19,"The cake was soft and fluffy, adequately moist and looked so good with the red coloring."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,20,It was not too sweet and all together just very enjoyable.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,21,For the rest of the cupcakes I found them rather average.
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,22,"The problem I have with cupcakes is that they tend to be very very sweet, so much so I will normally just scrape off most of the icing and eat the cake with a thin layer of it."
nwAvJbudYmKOTz9-rM7vYw,23,"It paled slightly in comparison to Plain Vanila Bakery's cupcakes, but on its own it does pretty well."
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,0,"Though this is the first time I am trying Thye Moh Guan's Tau Sar Piah since it became a part of Breadtalk Group, they are still as delicious and no wonder it has been so popular over the years =D There are a total of five flavours, in addition to the traditional teochew mooncake."
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,1,The classic versions are of course their sweet and savoury piah.
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,2,The mung bean filling which was made from scratch is so aromatic and smooth.
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,3,I was surprised to find salted egg yolks in both flavours!
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,4,Another interesting flavour is the Double Delight: red bean paste and a sticky winter melon filling with melon seeds & dried orange peel.
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,5,The white sesame seeds added a nice crunch to this mild-savoury piah that reminded me of lao po bing (wife's biscuit).
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,6,But my favourite was the Spicy Pork Floss (aka Yuan Yang )!
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,7,"Paired together with the savoury mung bean and salted egg yolk, this novel invention is also highly suitable for those who can't take spicy food because the spice level has been balanced out by the tau sar."
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,8,I am a Teochew but this is my first time having this Traditional Teochew Mooncake.
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,9,"Made with white sesame, dried kumquat, five-spice powder, this has a light citrusy taste with quite firm, chewy texture due to the maltose."
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,10,Not everyone may like this old school sweet so perhaps it's an acquired taste.
XiXPhZZScBm5_W3QYG1zQA,11,"Luckily the tau sar piah is available in regular size all-year round at their outlets and in various flavours such as cranberry, etc (the mooncakes are medium size) It's time for me to make a trip down again and stock up supplies at home!"
croA-sPfJ1L-RrmXlLf3Lw,0,Had to have the Singaporean Dish of chili crab - so chose this place to stop.
croA-sPfJ1L-RrmXlLf3Lw,1,"Food was excellent, wait staff friendly but was more interested in visiting with each other."
croA-sPfJ1L-RrmXlLf3Lw,2,I recommend the chili crab!
croA-sPfJ1L-RrmXlLf3Lw,3,!
tzKCqcSNj-QOJOhcBuU0oA,0,"A very intimate setting by Marina Bay, may not have the best view of the Bay Area because it is partially blocked by Clifford pier and The Fullerton Bay."
tzKCqcSNj-QOJOhcBuU0oA,1,"Unfortunately they didn't have any happy hour promotions, so things were pretty pricy, but they did mix some really yummy drinks!"
tzKCqcSNj-QOJOhcBuU0oA,2,We had the wagyu crostini and some scallops on cheese.
tzKCqcSNj-QOJOhcBuU0oA,3,"The wagyu was extremely well done, with the garnishes sautÃ©ed perfectly."
tzKCqcSNj-QOJOhcBuU0oA,4,"The scallops were pretty okay, although the fried cheese was too dry for my liking."
tzKCqcSNj-QOJOhcBuU0oA,5,"Overall, I'd recommend this place for the drinks, and well oysters."
iOpGJyn7v3Km0InDnYwiWg,0,always yummy no matter which outlet i go.
iOpGJyn7v3Km0InDnYwiWg,1,my favorite on the menu is the golden squid head; it's hard to resist even when piping hot.
iOpGJyn7v3Km0InDnYwiWg,2,it's decently priced at $4.90 per serving.
iOpGJyn7v3Km0InDnYwiWg,3,I like the chewy texture and the spiciness that comes with it.
iOpGJyn7v3Km0InDnYwiWg,4,"you can choose to have it mild, medium or super hot."
iOpGJyn7v3Km0InDnYwiWg,5,warning: possible distortion of face when consuming item
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,0,Don't quite get the long lines.
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,1,"Ok, it is a better than average kind of fishball noodles."
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,2,I would love eating it but not if I need to line up for 30 min.
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,3,"The fishballs are not big, bouncy and yet soft."
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,4,I had the dry noodle version and the chilli is very spicy.
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,5,It is not oily though so that is good.
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,6,Most people ordered the soup version or the kway teow-mee version.
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,7,Maybe next time.
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,8,The stall only opens at noon.
Toh3dAnIVx13S2nHXJ3hBg,9,So don't expect to have fishball noodles for breakfast.
FbQ2fX43_-j7GjIJlMGcGQ,0,Brightly lit bakery with plenty of options.
FbQ2fX43_-j7GjIJlMGcGQ,1,My friend specially recommended the Belgium dark chocolate bread roll and it did not disappoint.
FbQ2fX43_-j7GjIJlMGcGQ,2,Buying 4 pieces together is cheaper than buying each piece separately.
FbQ2fX43_-j7GjIJlMGcGQ,3,Since it was my first time trying I decided to get 1 piece first.
FbQ2fX43_-j7GjIJlMGcGQ,4,1 piece was actually quite satisfying as the bread was pretty dense and the filling was creamy.
FbQ2fX43_-j7GjIJlMGcGQ,5,The dark chocolate flavour was strong and not too sweet.
FbQ2fX43_-j7GjIJlMGcGQ,6,Probably one of the better bakeries in Kallang Wave Mall.
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,0,Swissbake breaks my heart.
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,1,"Their recent collaboration with Toblerone (YES that triangular Swiss chocolate bar) - Toblerone chocolate puff, it was... as my 2 star rating indicates, MEH."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,2,"The centre was pretty hollow, and the chocolate just laced the walls thinly."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,3,HOW CAN!?
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,4,Such an incredible chance to wow the public and it falls short of people's chocolate fantasies.
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,5,"In their regular line though, the chocolate rolls are good, the distinct texture and thick chocolately filling satisfies your cravings."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,6,"The cheese straws are good too, firm and cheesy, it's an easy snack to chew on during ""working on deadlines"" times."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,7,"I don't know much about European pastries, but most pastries in Swissbake are super flaky, drops everywhere like snowflakes, best to eat them from that paper bag."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,8,"I was recommended to Swissbake by one colleague, who enthusiastically told me that Swissbake was started by a Swiss pastry chef who has had 30 years of mastery."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,9,"My colleague loves their chicken mushroom pie, claiming that it is a must-try."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,10,"The pie is huge, bigger than my palm; it's rich with filling and looks like it will fill up a hungry stomach in no time."
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,11,Oh and they always have samples of their new pastries to try at the counter.
MPnhEFBUBj4-2dv1BRMl6Q,12,It's useful especially if it involves something risky like spinach puff.
oUrWZ-rRzeRitF7Bjw7csw,0,"When you ask me where to find one of the best chocolate strawberries in Singapore, I'll say go to Chocz!"
oUrWZ-rRzeRitF7Bjw7csw,1,They sell chocolate strawberries from small to big sizes and charges them accordingly.
oUrWZ-rRzeRitF7Bjw7csw,2,I will usually go for the big strawberries as they are quite sweet and melts very well with the chocolates!
oUrWZ-rRzeRitF7Bjw7csw,3,It's a definite must try when you are in the area and feeling peckish!
VjlJKI66ekAH7e49jn6gAw,0,"Esplanade used to be a major hangout spot for my friends and I back in the day, and I do remember one of them getting a skewer of strawberries covered in chocolate... they were pretty good!"
VjlJKI66ekAH7e49jn6gAw,1,Though I recalled the price to be anywhere from $4.50 - $6.50 (whoa mama!
VjlJKI66ekAH7e49jn6gAw,2,that's way too much for 4 medium-sized strawberries encrusted in semi-deluxe choc).
32OLjGbnqDT-fS9M8HwHFw,0,"Affordable, friendly helpful staff."
32OLjGbnqDT-fS9M8HwHFw,1,I tried the roti prata with onion for breakfast 1.70 Delicious grab a coffee next door to go with it
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,0,I tried it out of curiosity.
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,1,"Despite the ample samples, I took a gander at a loaf that had figs, red wine and rye amongst other things."
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,2,"Wasnt too sure if it was any good and considering it was pricey ($6 for the said loaf), I wanted to just experiment with one."
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,3,Soft and chewy and awesome figs in that loaf!
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,4,I loved it.
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,5,The bread was soft and I bought it around 8pm...imagine what it must taste like hot and fresh.
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,6,Gasp gasp.
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,7,I had to control myself not to finish the loaf and to save it for breakfast.
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,8,Should've bought two eh.
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,9,Will try the huge donut thingies and pesto bread next time round!
leOGnQqttmfuzczQckjcQw,10,Time for some carbo loading!
rkuJRSGU4CoPDintW_VnRg,0,"Proudly home-grown, BreadTalk is one of the most popular bakeries in Singapore."
rkuJRSGU4CoPDintW_VnRg,1,"With many outlets islandwide, the bakery stall provides one of the best variety of bread and buns to customers."
rkuJRSGU4CoPDintW_VnRg,2,"Some of my favourite products, which happens to be their best sellers include the floss bread, the cheese cake and the chocolate buns!"
rkuJRSGU4CoPDintW_VnRg,3,"Also, during special occasions and festivals, you can see BreadTalk naming their products accordingly, and sometimes even creating new buns to cater to the occasion!"
rkuJRSGU4CoPDintW_VnRg,4,"Such as Christmas, Chinese New Year and even the upcoming latest movie!"
rkuJRSGU4CoPDintW_VnRg,5,"The outlet at Harbourfront Centre is always crowded, even in the morning as many working adults buy their breakfast there."
rkuJRSGU4CoPDintW_VnRg,6,So fret not for you morning meal is settled.
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,0,This bakery is located in the Clementi 4 Food Loft.
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,1,It has only about 10 or so choices of buns.
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,2,They also have cheese tarts and mung bean cakes (tau sar pneah).
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,3,I wouldn't identify their buns as elegant because they are large pieces but they definitely give you enough bites for a light breakfast.
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,4,"Their flavor are generally good, except for their cheese buns which I thought are too oily."
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,5,"While it is not the best bakery in town, it is located at a convenient place for the surrounding residents who wants to grab a quick bite before boarding the bus."
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,6,They are also open as early as 7 am.
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,7,They bake their buns in batches of 24 so you are sure to get a fresh one.
KtA-DGwAbqdvzPY_pSnUZQ,8,"Plus, for the same price as more mainstream brands, you are getting 3-4 more bites."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,0,Was hankering for a snack to munch on and happened to pass by this bakery.
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,1,I pulled my buddies in to look around.
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,2,"At first glance, the buns don't look that different from those at Swee Heng Bakery."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,3,"Then we discovered cake rolls, marble cake and waffles, which aren't available at my bakery of choice."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,4,I settled on a cranberry muffin and a banana walnut muffin.
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,5,"A sign said buns were priced at 3 for $3, so I picked a durian bun, black pepper chicken and a cranberry cream cheese bun."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,6,"Yeah, all five for me."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,7,"I can eat you know, it just doesn't show."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,8,The buns were blehh.
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,9,I have never seen a mustard yellow banana walnut muffin (and it was topped with such a miserable amount of walnuts).
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,10,"I sensed no real fruit, but lots of food flavouring."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,11,"Plus, the muffins were so dry!"
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,12,The durian bun didn't fare any better - it tasted bitter.
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,13,"Swee Heng's durian buns are still king, for me."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,14,"Black pepper chicken bun, so-so lah."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,15,I had the cranberry cream bun afterwards.
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,16,"It was tooth-achingly sweet and stuffed with so much cream cheese, I felt like puking out everything I consumed before, so I decided to keep the other two items for breakfast the following day."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,17,"Lesson learnt: Next time, cross the road and grab something from Swee Heng Bakery instead."
Ne3OYtyXe68aQ9KCZlEOfA,18,Then strangers won't give me weird looks if I walk around clutching at my bloated tummy.
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,0,Came by here and heard from my friend that their cheesecakes were nice!
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,1,It didn't take long to find it since it's just above the Dhoby Ghaut MRT.
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,2,Went with the classic cheesecup that I had bought on the sugar app.
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,3,For $3.30 it's Abit pricey for such small cheese cake in a tiny cup.
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,4,"But it did taste like how original cheese cakes taste like but as you scooped the cheese cake, I wasn't able to scoop up the biscuit crumb base."
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,5,It was too hard and had stuck to the bottom of the cupcake sheet.
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,6,I do like the idea that they sell cheesecakes in a smaller package rather than a slice.
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,7,It's definitely easier on my daily calorie limit but at $3+ for just a mouthful of cheesecake?
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,8,This reminds me of paying a lot more for less!
ZUik--HpNs8qmSZraxW_jw,9,Nonetheless still a great place for that cheesecake cravings!
OdRoAYiFI9nJE8tcwxX5KA,0,It's pricey.
OdRoAYiFI9nJE8tcwxX5KA,1,$3.30 for a plain churros.
OdRoAYiFI9nJE8tcwxX5KA,2,The dough was half cooked on the inside though the outside is completely crispy and brown.
OdRoAYiFI9nJE8tcwxX5KA,3,I'm guessing it's because the oil temperature was too high.
OdRoAYiFI9nJE8tcwxX5KA,4,The sugar was coated evenly on the surface and you will bite into lumps.
VTmsRIWqBxWLFbIP4XzZcg,0,Very good cool refreshing soft tofu desserts.
VTmsRIWqBxWLFbIP4XzZcg,1,I had the almond ($1.50) and the chocolate ($2).
VTmsRIWqBxWLFbIP4XzZcg,2,The texture is soft smooth and amazing.
VTmsRIWqBxWLFbIP4XzZcg,3,Superb quality at a great price.
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,0,Mr Bean's logo is just an adorable soy bean.
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,1,Just Soya pudding taste just as cute and cozy as the logo.
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,2,It is made with 100% freshly brewed soya milk and it taste soft and silky.
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,3,Just the perfect lunch desert!
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,4,"I'm not really a fan of the other items they serve like the soybean cheese pancakes or the Strawberry Soya Smoothie or Strawberry Cream Cheese Pancake, that's just a bit too much for me."
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,5,I prefer to have a simple and pure soya product.
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,6,"The staff at this outlet is a bit impatient and not so friendly, I guess it is because the long queues and they get agitated and stressed."
ADpvj1FXcKWgV7hytOCWDg,7,Or maybe they know they don't have to try hard because their business is successful anyway.
FdOs-YmjrbM5WSaKDHopsw,0,Ice cream Flavors available: quite a good selection of the common flavors and some premiums.
FdOs-YmjrbM5WSaKDHopsw,1,Texture of ice cream: not smooth enough as there is ice blocks inside Price: rather expensive for the rough textured ice cream.
FdOs-YmjrbM5WSaKDHopsw,2,"But overall good enough place for me to hide out from the hot afternoon sun as the aircon is super strong, lighting is good."
FdOs-YmjrbM5WSaKDHopsw,3,Not yet try out the Belgium waffles though....
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,0,Expectations weren't high since they were one of few places open past midnight but I must admit I was delightfully surprised by Ruyi.
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,1,Think of it as a fast casual Chinese spot.
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,2,I appreciate the take-out packaging that keeps the soup and noodles separate till you're ready to eat.
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,3,"We ordered the BBQ pork & shrimp dumpling noodles (dry), the shrimp dumplings noodle soup, and the stewed minced pork rice with soy egg."
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,4,The noodles had a wonderful texture and the dry noodles in particular had great flavor between the dark sauce and chilli.
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,5,The shrimp dumplings were plump and delicious with a silky skin.
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,6,"All in all, a great late night eat."
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,7,The fact that Ruyi is open 24 hours is a huge plus.
PAqsyXtd0h_fiYtXcnWjDg,8,The fact that the food happens to be quite tasty is a nice surprise to boot!
I2o-OdCWz_LF-uPJCNuxbw,0,Swee Heng does one thing really well: serve up fresh bread at an affordable price.
I2o-OdCWz_LF-uPJCNuxbw,1,"Granted, bread in fancy flavours these days aren't hard to find, but Swee Heng frequently has promotions which let you bring home a number of bread for a price, such as three piece of bread for S$4."
I2o-OdCWz_LF-uPJCNuxbw,2,"It's located very close to Boon Keng MRT, so it makes for a great quick fuss-free breakfast before your morning commute."
I2o-OdCWz_LF-uPJCNuxbw,3,"As far as competition with the Q Bread across the street goes, I don't think there's much of a difference, just how convenient it is."
I2o-OdCWz_LF-uPJCNuxbw,4,The neighbourhood is big enough for two bakeries anyway.
I2o-OdCWz_LF-uPJCNuxbw,5,But I visit Swee Heng more because it's closer to me.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,0,Little Wimbly Lu is the sister store of Wimbly Lu.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,1,This dessert place is a stone's throw away from the Chomp Chomp Food Centre and has limited seating (both indoor and outdoor).
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,2,It was packed on a Monday night.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,3,I got the waffle with salted caramel ice cream.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,4,I had the ice cream served in a separate cup.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,5,The waffle came in 2 pieces of a quadrant.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,6,The waffle texture was good.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,7,Crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,8,It came with a small cup of maple syrup which gave the waffle most of its taste.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,9,"Without it, the waffle was pretty bland."
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,10,The ice cream I got was ok - too buttery for my liking.
ArERxvZa2g3NZJYA2sLKyQ,11,"All in all, it was an ok after dinner experience."
IEgg50VsHY8ECE6BxHc-Tw,0,Not a bad breakfast place especially if you have a hankering for the local.
IEgg50VsHY8ECE6BxHc-Tw,1,It appears their speciality is their thick-cut toast although I have yet to try their non-breakfast dishes.
IEgg50VsHY8ECE6BxHc-Tw,2,Had their peanut butter on thick toast which was pretty good.
IEgg50VsHY8ECE6BxHc-Tw,3,Wouldn't mind a repeat visit.
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,0,Best bites ...... is a eatery which locates at science park 1.
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,1,The name sounds good ya ....
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,2,There is not much eatery around this vicinity and the other nearest eatery is located at DSO.
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,3,"This eatery serves different kind of food ranging from Western, Indian, Â Chinese food and the price is around average hawker centre price."
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,4,"This eatery has indoor and outdoor seating, therefore you can have a choice to choose."
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,5,The vendor of chicken rice and wanton Mee stall got relocate here from NUH staff canteen.
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,6,It's great to see familiar faces but of cause the price still remain the same.
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,7,"During peak hour this eatery is full of people, so normally I will just ask to take away as it's crowded."
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,8,There are juices and fruit stall as well as a small minimart just around the corner.
Ezp7iHTCexd8Wc_hL86FuA,9,"If you happen to be around this area, do pop over to have a meal here......"
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,0,"Surprisingly, the ramen wasn't too shabby."
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,1,I had the cha shu ramen and the broth was thick and flavorful and ingredients fairly substantial.
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,2,My only gripe is that the noodles get a little soft when left soaking for too long - I haven't quite acquired the slurping skills of a bona fide Japanese ramen slurper yet!
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,3,"Not without splashing all over, that is."
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,4,"There are also gyozas in the menu, and strangely there are a couple of options that made me go 'eh?"
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,5,"', namely the homemade gyoza, and the crispy gyoza."
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,6,So we were wondering.. hm.. perhaps the crispy one isn't homemade then?
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,7,"And so we opted for the homemade one, since pan fried gyozas all come crispy right?"
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,8,WRONG.
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,9,"The homemade gyozas weren't crispy, and the verdict - mind blown."
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,10,"Filling was rather porky, so if you ask if I'll order it again, here enters my favourite bear meme - HOW ABOUT NO complete with raised paws."
1-040bd-MAi0uwR4LKMtnQ,11,I'd go for the noodles again though!
DCRoIT9l23rAdiDKwjiztQ,0,First time here visiting a friend after church.
DCRoIT9l23rAdiDKwjiztQ,1,"Small establishment, if you don't stay nearby, I'm sure you would not even noticed this place."
DCRoIT9l23rAdiDKwjiztQ,2,Ordered standard stuff but Ikan Assam Pedas is not bad.
7Btn4WBctVAsg8KBuTSWxg,0,"Local alley food, interesting and must try for the full Singapore experience."
7Btn4WBctVAsg8KBuTSWxg,1,The black thick 3 cup sauce was yummy with especially with the sesame oil porridge.
7Btn4WBctVAsg8KBuTSWxg,2,The food is good but the service and cleanliness is questionable.
7Btn4WBctVAsg8KBuTSWxg,3,We ordered water and coke and it was a battle to try to get drinks.
7Btn4WBctVAsg8KBuTSWxg,4,May not come again unless bring friends along.
2Uj5BI-ZzAzL-dptw7OkRg,0,This outlet of Muthu's is probably the one that still tries to maintain the high standards it was once renowned for.
2Uj5BI-ZzAzL-dptw7OkRg,1,The one at Dempsey is just a poor excuse to overcharge people for simple dishes.
2Uj5BI-ZzAzL-dptw7OkRg,2,"The fish head curry over here is still as good as it was when I had it as a little kid, while the rest of the dishes have not really been consistent."
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,0,"Now, this review is solely on the food."
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,1,We came a little after lunchtime and the service was slacking for an almost empty place.
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,2,"However, food was great."
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,3,"We had a few dishes - the fish cutlet, the fish roe and the fish head curry."
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,4,Fish cutlets and fish roe were...meh..to say the least.
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,5,But the fish head curry was nice and fresh.
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,6,I devoured all the gloriousness of the fish's cheek and jaw and eyes!
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,7,Yum!
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,8,I loved the addition of pineapple in the curry; almost a palette cleanser.
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,9,I'd say skip everything else and get the fish head curry.
YklT5tIA_aPtXy_IKc_26A,10,Worth it!
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,0,"I have been told that this restaurants' standards had dropped in the past 1-2 years, but I still wanted to try it with my family."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,1,"Unfortunately, we were disappointed."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,2,"We had fish head curry, the dish was quite disappointing."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,3,"The fish was hard, over cooked, not fresh and had a hint of an off-putting fishy smell."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,4,"The fish was placed on a big deep bowl with plenty curry sauce, but the strong curry spice couldn't cover the fishy smell."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,5,The fish head curry was so disappointing!
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,6,"When we told the waiter the fish was not fresh, he replied, the fish was cooked to order."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,7,"My point is, cooking a fish that wasn't fresh in the first place doesnt make it any fresher!"
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,8,Another dish is the lamb dish.
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,9,It was very chewy.
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,10,"Since they had a buffet in the afternoon that included this dish, I was wondering if they just gave us the leftovers."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,11,"Additionally, one of my family members and I got bitten by a mosquito."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,12,"My friend already made a reservation Â in this restaurant, and after my dinner I immediately told them to cancel it."
k3y-wGVmMQXtA7wkgNZJFw,13,This restaurant was a disappointment.
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,0,OMG YUM!!!!
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,1,"Not only was the food good, but the service was great as well."
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,2,I got the Mutha's Chicken Chuuka and it had a wonderful spicy taste to it.
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,3,I will definitely be back for more of that!!
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,4,Definitely get the mixed appetizer as well.
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,5,I left so full that I needed to be rolled out of there.
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,6,Lol.
CEanQA25VuKSZCsWq0b3hg,7,Their cheese naan is great also.
itOBwWhDnFAZnY-m302aFQ,0,Heard so much about this place and finally tried it out yesterday while in Singapore and I tell you it was amazing.
itOBwWhDnFAZnY-m302aFQ,1,The food was great and you just can't say enough about this place.
itOBwWhDnFAZnY-m302aFQ,2,Service was top notch and Narayan was awesome.
itOBwWhDnFAZnY-m302aFQ,3,He took such good care of me and my family.
itOBwWhDnFAZnY-m302aFQ,4,You have to try this if you are ever in Singapore.
6kowyGNsdurCcKF6EQ7ZWQ,0,Ordered the waffles and utterly disappointed!
6kowyGNsdurCcKF6EQ7ZWQ,1,Do not come for the waffles.
6kowyGNsdurCcKF6EQ7ZWQ,2,Hard as rock and when requested for a new piece.
6kowyGNsdurCcKF6EQ7ZWQ,3,They came back with a melted ice cream.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,0,This is about a 2.5 star place.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,1,Espresso no good.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,2,Same stuff you'll find at Starbucks.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,3,The moelleux citron framboise was ok.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,4,I like that it wasn't overly sweet.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,5,I do like the venue.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,6,It's nicely decorated and hearing la vie en rose in the background is very nice.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,7,But then that bubble is popped by the cutlery.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,8,Am I in prison?
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,9,The fork is so thin and pre bent like a child was playing with it or an amateur magician.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,10,Cheapens the experience.
K22bgHRfdv-FRFWxAjFYdg,11,Maybe I'm nuts.
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,0,Ho hum food at the restored colonial buildings near Seletar airbase.
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,1,"Wheeler's Estate is one of four newly opened restaurants located at ""The Oval"", a set of restored colonial buildings formerly occupied by RAF servicemen who worked at the Seletar Airbase right up till 1971."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,2,"Hipsters and instagrammers, rejoice."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,3,"There is that ""cool"" atmosphere, with spacious surroundings, mood lighting and conservation buildings that hint of an era gone by."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,4,However the same cannot be said of the food...
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,5,"The menu is a little pricey, with the usual steaks, fish n chips and pastas."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,6,"I went for the S$99 T-Bone and a grilled octopus starter, which I almost instantly regretted the minute it arrived on the table."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,7,"It was plated immaculately, but was chewier than an eraser and definitely overcooked."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,8,"The steak wasn't much better, rather bloodless and dry, without much flavor."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,9,It was placed on a gas grill (smelled of gas) and the sauces overpowered the steak.
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,10,Perhaps I ordered the wrong menu items?
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,11,"For me, food quality comes first."
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,12,I guess it's 4 stars for the atmosphere but 2 stars for the disappointing food.
LeNGN72qf2BTQVueImNNig,13,"I'll most probably be back for a drink or dessert, but will definitely skip the food."
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,0,"To be fair, we came here only because of a bad experience at Wildseed Cafe (I waited for 20 minutes, only to discover by chance that my name had been struck off)."
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,1,The food were generally not bad.
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,2,I only would say (1) i didn't quite enjoy the crab benedict that was served cold (the crab salad part was fridge cold) (2) the breads across all 3 dishes were the same brioche toast.
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,3,maybe different bread options would be good to keep this from being so monotonous.
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,4,biggest gripe was the prices.
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,5,we spent $120 for these 3 mains and 3 coffees.
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,6,Quite a hefty sum for a place that is so far out and need some form of public transport or taxi to get to.
7PbW6gg5a_cWP7Wlw7jVRw,7,service was all youngsters who are inexperienced.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,0,Is a gem in the neighborhood.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,1,I love their cakes especially Chocolate Bomb - heart melting chocolate indulging experience.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,2,Strawberry shortcake - the sweet aroma of vanilla will send you to cloud nine.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,3,And the fluffy sponge cake is so soft.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,4,Sakura tea - Now then I realize how good Sakura smells.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,5,And it is refreshing.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,6,Love it.
voTUR5uUXYKjPjfQCf1hmw,7,Staff are friendly and beautiful.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,0,Cupcakes bought in the morning or earlier in the day were definitely much better than those bought later in the day.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,1,This would probably be true of all baked goods where they would taste better when they were not left out in the open for too long.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,2,Prices have increased a little.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,3,It used to be $3 for a cupcake (regular flavors) and it is now $3.20.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,4,Add 50 cents to the specials of the day.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,5,"The cupcake has a cake texture, a bit moist and soft (when bought in the morning)."
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,6,It gets a bit drier and harder when eaten in the evening or next day.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,7,"The frosting is creamy, some has a buttery taste."
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,8,I like that it is not overly sweet and that the frosting is not too much.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,9,Though some would prefer a bit more frosting as the proportion was more of 1/5 to 1/4 frosting to 4/5 or 3/4 cake.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,10,So some of the cake will not get the frosting.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,11,"I am still not a huge fan of Twelve Cupcakes but since they seem to open up near the MRT entrance/exit, they will do in a pinch when I need to bring something to a party or when I want something easy to eat on the go as a quick fix dessert or just to get it for friends."
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,12,Convenience is a huge factor for purchasing cupcakes here.
5-CHkXzMAK5yivqQNkcL5w,13,Plus the mini cupcakes make a great party gift or for days you want to try all the 12 flavors without the major guilt of indulgence.
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,0,"I don't go for traditional soya bean so if that's the kind you like, skip this."
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,1,"This is in the style of ""Lao Ban"" and it was a nice surprise."
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,2,"It was similar but it tasted a bit different, perhaps a touch more ""beany"" and less sweet."
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,3,"No queues, $1.50 for the soya beancurd original."
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,4,"Sweet but not cloyingly so, the slippery soft coldness was perfect for this very hot day."
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,5,Plus this is a dessert which is very easy to eat when you have a mouth ulcer.
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,6,I've had Lao Ban a number of times and my regular soya beancurd shop is Yummy Soy which is even more similar to Lao Ban and near my place.
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,7,"Compared to those 2, I detected a very slight powdery texture at times in this."
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,8,Not enough to stop me from enjoying it.
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,9,But that coupled with the plastic spoon they gave me being seriously very rough on the edges and of a very low quality.
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,10,"Seriously, I bit myself already, I don't need to slice my mouth open next with a plastic implement."
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,11,Rating is therefore 4 star.
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,12,I will be happy to buy if I'm craving beancurd and am in the area.
uHIoPRT2Qw2TQ9VxRk5JZw,13,They had other flavours like durian and also a mango sago that I would like to try next time.
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,0,"Chendol is this amazing Malaysian dessert made of shaved ice, palm sugar, coconut milk, pandang, and other goodies like fresh fruit."
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,1,"Not that many places serve it or serve it well, so when I saw a long line here, I thought it must be amazing."
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,2,"It was good, but not mind blowing."
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,3,"The service is quick, and the portions are big."
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,4,It's one of the more popular Malaysian food stalls at Changi Village Market & Food Centre.
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,5,"Aside from that, though, I have had better Chendol."
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,6,It will hit the spot if you've got a serious craving nonetheless.
FIqHiCASr-fkwAgO3Q0AMg,7,It's a smaller stall within a larger Malaysian food stall.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,0,Chendol is a desert.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,1,Coconut milk.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,2,Coconut 'sugar' or colloquially known as gula Melaka.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,3,Shaved ice.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,4,It's 2 bucks a serving!!
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,5,What a bargain.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,6,";)) Basically, what this is is a little bit of food orgasm in your mouth."
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,7,The combinations of authentic gula Melaka and coconut milk and other ingredients makes this such a wonderful desert.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,8,I have friends who drive from distances to have this.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,9,Amazing!!
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,10,Have been a favorite of mine for years and I suspect will continue to be so.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,11,Just wish I didn't know the caloric count on this :pp Ps.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,12,The kuehs or nonya cake is also very good.
20lkuybLFMizj8SeTQfYCw,13,Very well made
1zDDX1ZIeh2JzN7WMHaWtA,0,What an amazing place!
1zDDX1ZIeh2JzN7WMHaWtA,1,Just off the shopping Malls of JB and You are in a mini oasis.
1zDDX1ZIeh2JzN7WMHaWtA,2,Incense burns on the counter offering a sweet smell to the gods of liquor as you swig away crude and yet oddly refined glasses of fermented coconut from tiger beer glasses.
1zDDX1ZIeh2JzN7WMHaWtA,3,I love it.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,0,"The shop was a flurry of activity on a Saturday afternoon - there was a queue in front of a lady standing at a rack of assorted pastries, another behind the lady solely in charge of doling out tau sar piah, and a third one at the cashier's."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,1,People were outside the shop working on adding the finishing touches to mooncakes whilst surrounded by trays of bean paste fillings that had been laid out to cool.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,2,"It was a little chaotic, but everyone seemed to know what they were doing."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,3,"As I made my way around trying to make sense of the way things were ran, a frazzled looking man emerged from the kitchen holding a tray of newborn mooncakes, moving swiftly to slot it into one of the holding racks outside the shop."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,4,What I loved about this shop was how unabashedly Teochew it was.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,5,"I know this is Hougang and I know we're talkin' old school bakery here, but I was still caught off guard by the aunties speaking to me in dialect."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,6,Dude... that almost never happens in Singapore.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,7,"The aunties didn't even seem to register my surprise, like it never crossed their minds that I might not be able to understand what they were saying."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,8,I was very pleased to be considered one of them.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,9,Never mind that I actually am.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,10,"I then proceeded to flex my, ahem, linguistic muscles by replying in Teochew."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,11,"A little stilted due to years of non-use, but perfectly comprehensible, if I may say so myself."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,12,Cue tears of pride and joy.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,13,"Tau sar piah, $20.80 for a box of 10 - For all the humble and homely qualities that Soo Teck Lim so effortlessly embodies, it must be said that their pastries don't come cheap."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,14,"At a little over $2.00 per piece (assuming you buy a box of 10), the price point places the tau sar piah here as one of the most expensive I've come across."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,15,Don't be a wuss and let that stop you; just think about how illogical it would be to willingly fork out $4.00 for that ridiculously tiny lavender bundt cake from Carpenter & Cook yet refuse to part with $2.00 for a notoriously hard to make tau sar piah.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,16,"I got a mix of flavours for the 10 tau sar piah: Salty, sweet, pineapple and black sesame."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,17,"Those flavours are listed in order of preference, post-tasting."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,18,Let's start with the not-as-good.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,19,Notice I didn't say not-so-good.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,20,"That's because all the tau sar piah were, objectively speaking, brilliant."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,21,In spite of the conspicuous absence of lard in their Teochew pastries - I'm sure you see the word vegetarian in the shop name right - the tau sar piah crusts were both flaky and crisp.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,22,I didn't take very well to the black sesame flavour because it was quite peppery (??
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,23,"), and I would've preferred a pineapple filling with a chunkier texture as opposed to the smooth jam that was used here."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,24,"The sweet and salty flavours were, on the other hand, faultless."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,25,"The sugar level in the bean paste used for the sweet tau sar piah was nicely reined in, allowing for the texture of the freshly and finely ground bean paste to shine."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,26,"As for the salty tau sar piah, the crumbly mung bean filling with its subtle notes of five spice powder and just the slightest dash of pepper, was so, friggin', amazing."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,27,"Teochew yam mooncake, $11.30 each - The yam mooncake here was decent though not mindblowing."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,28,"The filling, in line with Soo Teck Lim's philosophy of keeping things ""not so sweet"" (it's even printed on their paper bags), was where the absence of lard was keenly felt."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,29,"It was devoid of the depth of flavour that the Eater Palace mooncakes possess, what with the latter's shallot-y orh nee fillings."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,30,Crust-wise it didn't fare so well either.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,31,"Truth be told I was expecting quite a lot more for an eleven-dollar mooncake, but I suppose they've done as well as they can for vegetarian mooncakes."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,32,As you can tell I am a firm believer of the necessity of meat in one's diet.
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,33,Would I go so far as to call the tau sar piah sold here the best tau sar piah in Singapore?
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,34,"I'd argue that it's definitely up there with the big boys in the Balestier area, but returning to Soo Teck Lim isn't going to stop me from craving the buttery tau sar piah from Loong Fatt."
b7Dz18jCoeSAkxWkzwmAYA,35,"Them's apples and oranges, and sometimes a pig just wants to have it all."

uJxTRR5gkZTaX0IffVffRA,1,Chocolate come in various qualities depending on the brand.
uJxTRR5gkZTaX0IffVffRA,2,Luxurious brand of chocolates provides greater satisfaction in consumption due to good quality ingredients used.

uJxTRR5gkZTaX0IffVffRA,5,The place lacks the frills of a stylish store selling good quality chocolates.
uJxTRR5gkZTaX0IffVffRA,6,"Instead, the shop comprises of a decent cashier counter and product displays surrounded by four blank walls."
uJxTRR5gkZTaX0IffVffRA,7,"However, its plain setting doesn't reflect the quality of the chocolates on sale because most of the brands are top notch."
uJxTRR5gkZTaX0IffVffRA,8,Anyone can get good quality chocolates on a budget at this store as a treat or gift.

t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,0,"A typical Asian bread bakery with the addition of cakes, fresh lava cheese tarts, and freshly made waffles as well!"
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,1,Review is based on lava cheese tarts and waffles :) I've never had their breads before but people seem to buy them often from what I've seen.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,2,Definitely part of the fad of cheese tarts here in Singapore and Prima deli does a decent job at them.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,3,Lava cheese tart original flavor is tasty.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,4,Not overly sweet.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,5,I've tried them warm as well as cold and both are good.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,6,They are $2.40 which is pricey but around the normal for cheese tarts that I've seen around Singapore.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,7,They make waffles right in front of you and have many waffle irons.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,8,They actually are so fresh they smell up the first floor with a good smell.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,9,I like their plain is my favorite.
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,10,"But they have peanut, kaya, chocolate, etc."
t7eEgYwynUFHEMN9nGbtuQ,11,Their plain waffle is $1.40.
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,0,Gin Thye's website has this opening statement: Few things bring people together like good food.
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,1,Yelp should become friends with Gin Thye.
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,2,"Whenever I walk past this bakery, it's the aroma of waffles that makes my head turn."
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,3,"At peak periods there's always a tiny queue - usually made up of students - they know that a mean waffle equals to a fluffy yet crispy waffle, generous heavy filling, and has to come CHEAP."
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,4,A heartwarming waffle like that can make a tired student's day.
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,5,"The location's at the blocks of HDB flats next to Bishan Junction 8, it's one of the more prominent bakeries, look for the one with the waffle station on the left, though it has a sign attached to it saying: 'WAFFLES MAKE THE OTHER SIDE'."
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,6,"Gin Thye is good at their cakes, after all they've been making it since the year 1964."
mYea2Sks8UQ80nFdBvBv5A,7,You can pre-order cakes from them for various occasions.
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,0,The name Emicakes has always sounded really cute to me.
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,1,I usually drop by the Plaza Singapura outlet for some mini desserts.
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,2,I really like how their mini desserts and cakes are served in plastic cups; really cute and innovative.
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,3,"Last year, my friend ordered a really gigantic chocolate cake (fit for 35 to 40 people) called Ultimate Brownie Addiction and it was absolutely delicious."
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,4,It stays true to its name with a brownie-like texture that is rich in chocolate goodness.
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,5,"Products at Emicakes are neither cheap nor pricey, with mini delights that go from $2 onwards."
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,6,"For the mini desserts, the eggless mint chocolate is my favourite because it's both healthy and moderately minty."
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,7,"If you like the lovely combination of mint and chocolate, then you have to try their mint choco items here."
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,8,I've tried the D24 Durian Delight here but it's not really up to my liking.
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,9,The durian puree inside is a tad too sweet and the pudding cream doesn't really burst with durian flavour.
gLqaUdVTMA0DQLuUlDW21A,10,"If you need something more durian-y then try their durian puffs, which have authentic and chunky durian filling."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,0,"If you don't want to pay for all the attractions on Sentosa, there isn't so much you can do."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,1,"We took a break at Tastes of Asia, and it was nice to stop for a cool dessert."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,2,"The place was completely dead around 5 pm on December 26th though, so it was kind of eerie sitting in a huge restaurant with only one other table filled."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,3,"The chendol for 3.00 was delicious, shaved ice with red bean jelly, coconut milk and palm sugar syrup."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,4,"The chng tng (cold) was also very good, with dry longan broth with barley, white fungus, jelly, ginko nuts, and rice pearls."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,5,Both desserts were really sweet though.
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,6,"I felt sorry for the young staff, who tried to look busy in the empty restaurant."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,7,"There were about 4 servers with not much to do, so they kept walking by our table to ask if everything was ok."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,8,"Normally that would have bugged me, but I let it pass this time so it would give them something to do."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,9,"Actually, they probably could have cleaned the restaurant better, but perhaps they couldn't do it in front of customers."
_aBvf9x1kmWdDDMzYQrZqQ,10,"A dried piece of rice fell from the top of the booth when we sat down, which was kind of weird and also disgusting."
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,0,Big chunks of fried chickens.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,1,That's what you'll get here in Texas Chicken.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,2,"I got a 2 piece spicy chicken meal and a dessert, which consist of a honey biscuit and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, drizzled with chocolate sauce."
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,3,"NOTE TO SELF: Next time, just get a one piece chicken meal!"
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,4,This outlet is quite cram if you ask me.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,5,The ordering counter is right at the entrance.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,6,You will need to go through a small corridor at the side to get to the back where all the seats are located.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,7,"I have seen other Texas outlets, but this one was quite reclusive in a way."
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,8,Most of the seats at the other outlets are opened to the public eye.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,9,Taste wise...
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,10,I don't know.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,11,I personally feel KFC is still the best where fast food / fried chicken franchise in Singapore is concern.
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,12,"Although, one thing I felt they succeeded in ousting KFC is their soft honey biscuits."
qvPfILyUPjBouPscVDe9NA,13,They taste so much better.
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,0,Kinara at Holland V is an Indian restaurant that's been around here for ages.
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,1,"Food is not cheap, but its very good."
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,2,Service is great and you can chose to eat indoors or outdoors.
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,3,"We opted for outdoors, and it's nice to people watch while having your meal."
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,4,"We ordered a lot of food, but it was all so great we finished almost all of it."
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,5,"The tandoori fish was very good, as was the palak paneer."
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,6,The buttered naan was also really great.
dq-7KUxLWEpdG3_PrALZNA,7,"Again its not a cheap and you can get cheaper Indian food for the same quality elsewhere, but it is a nice splurge for Indian food, if you want to dine a bit classier."
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,0,"At Mumbai Magic, for $12 you get the Mumbai Magic thali, with a free flow of rice, chapati, dishes for them, buttermilk and dessert (cardamon milk when we were there)."
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,1,My partner's Indian colleague says the food here reminds her of home cooking.
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,2,Make of that what you will.
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,3,"As for my evaluation, some of the dishes were very good, some were good and some were okay, but all were unlimited and it was only $12."
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,4,"Oh, this restaurant only serves vegetarian food, but hey you can't have everything."
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,5,"We also tried some other drinks on top of what was included (for one because butter milk is an acquired taste, but mainly because I'm greedy)."
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,6,"The badam milk was not that sweet, and the nut taste was alright - not as strong as I'd expected."
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,7,However the mango lassi was super concentrated and thick and had a great mango taste .
CO-7b6KzoFLjrQTh98KHiA,8,Both were only $4; this restaurant is a steal!
qpBKXgfFZgGxnRBypfFPFA,0,Sher Indian Garden is the Indian stall inside Bar Bar Blacksheep on Bukit Timah Road.
qpBKXgfFZgGxnRBypfFPFA,1,"Like the Thai stall, it is also pretty pricey for a food stall, but it is also very good."
qpBKXgfFZgGxnRBypfFPFA,2,One of the best Indian places in Singapore.
qpBKXgfFZgGxnRBypfFPFA,3,"They sell mostly Northern Indian cuisine like naan, briyani, curries and tandoori."
qpBKXgfFZgGxnRBypfFPFA,4,Their butter naan is amazing and their curries are so flavourful and tasty.
qpBKXgfFZgGxnRBypfFPFA,5,The staff is very nice and service is very fast and reliable.
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,0,"Ok, it' me ranting again, and even though I'm going get shouted down by the fans of Sher, but the truth, my truth, must out."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,1,"In a landscape of outstanding Indian cuisine, especially southern indian cuisine, which by the way is uniquely ubiquitous in Singapore by sheer coincidence of immigration, Sher must in my book be given a single star."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,2,"The food if considered on it's own merits will likely get 3 stars, it is after all serviceable and edible and recognizable as Indian and even Northern Indian cuisine."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,3,"But placed in close physical proximity to Forture Seafood's Chili and Salt Egg Crab and Blu's unfettered awesomeness in the realm of Hellenic cuisine, Sher's 3 stars quickly fade into the one twinkling light in a night of big bright stars and streaking comets."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,4,"So it's not that Sher is bad, but that there are so many other better choices and so close by that Sher is certainly a one star choice in such august company."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,5,"This is really utility Northern Indian characterized by much the same pedestrian offerings that I associate with the all you can eat ""Indian"" restaurants of the Western Pennsylvanian heartland, which if you think about it is likely to be one of the only remaining places where Indian food can be considered ""exotic"" or ""oriental""."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,6,"There will certainly be a naan, which is a doughy bread-food, something dry, cordy and colored red and on the menu as a Tandoori Chicken, and usually something grossly cuboidal in a desultory green sauce passing as paneer."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,7,"In Youngstown as here at Sher, Indian is offered up almost as a Hobson's choice, this is what we've got and you can take it or leave it."
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,8,"But unlike in Youngstown, you DO have a choice here, especially here in Singapore you are spoiled for choice!"
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,9,"And asserting your right to food that begins with a quality ingredient and is prepared to showcase just how important, fresh and awesome that ingredient is, is I believe your fundamental right as a human being, if not a Yelper!"
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,10,"Live Proud, ye Yelper, say no to mediocrity!"
Rar3WpX2pPs8-kb7gzRqJA,11,"No Sher, not tonight, not any night, you and your one bright star can go softly into that good night."
tybIHpvcN-ZMo1g8IobNxw,0,We ate at this Indian buffet restaurant thanks to a 50% discount.
tybIHpvcN-ZMo1g8IobNxw,1,It was ok.
tybIHpvcN-ZMo1g8IobNxw,2,Nothing fantastic to shout about.
tybIHpvcN-ZMo1g8IobNxw,3,4 vegetarian dishes & 2 non-veg dishes + basmati + free flow of plain and garlic naan.
tybIHpvcN-ZMo1g8IobNxw,4,I liked the dessert which was typical of Indian dessert and was really sweet.
tybIHpvcN-ZMo1g8IobNxw,5,"I don't know too much about Indian food, but they say in America if you see a Chinese restaurant patronized by Chinese then the food must be good."
tybIHpvcN-ZMo1g8IobNxw,6,"In this case, on this day, this Indian restaurant was patronized mostly by Chinese."
Nnx6Vz5RBCTTV0n2h-EMeQ,0,Hock Lam Beef just opened up it's 4 outlet in SIngapore in Alexandra Retail Centre.
Nnx6Vz5RBCTTV0n2h-EMeQ,1,"They are know for there 98 year old beef kway teow recipe in Singapore, which is handed down two generations since 1911."
Nnx6Vz5RBCTTV0n2h-EMeQ,2,The owner of the store was crowned Singapore's Beef noodle King in 2002.
Nnx6Vz5RBCTTV0n2h-EMeQ,3,"Locals recognize the quality of the labour intensive, homemade 24-hour boiled gourmet soup, the homemade gourmet chilli sauce with 13 ingredients, and Hand sliced beef cuts."
Nnx6Vz5RBCTTV0n2h-EMeQ,4,"Personally the soup and sauce has a complex lasting flavour, but the beef is ok only."
Nnx6Vz5RBCTTV0n2h-EMeQ,5,"If you don't mind waiting in queue for 15 min, please visit between 12:15 and 13:30."
3qRLCroeaWICZVNeEYmv0Q,0,"For fast food, the prices are a bit high."
3qRLCroeaWICZVNeEYmv0Q,1,"As expected, the food is very greasy."
3qRLCroeaWICZVNeEYmv0Q,2,"Although the crumb bits are tasty and the fish is decent, the overall experience is so-so."
3qRLCroeaWICZVNeEYmv0Q,3,"You might only come here if you are specifically craving for it or if you have vague memories of long lost Long John Silver's from years ago in the US, where it is now all but extinct."
mymeo0ghbx2xrIGoaG3JXQ,0,This Indian shop stands on its own and there are a few things I like about it.
mymeo0ghbx2xrIGoaG3JXQ,1,"1) Yummy biryani 2) Killer fried chicken 3) a few choices of not the oiliest vegetables 4) affordable 5) good teh tarik 6) strong fans 7) pleasant service 8) provides tissue at the cashier's Items 3, 4, 6 and 7 are why it wins out over the always crowded Shah Alam nearby."
mymeo0ghbx2xrIGoaG3JXQ,2,I like the biryani rice which is cooked in the dum style.
mymeo0ghbx2xrIGoaG3JXQ,3,Ie it's lightly fragrant and spiced and not flavoured from having poured curry gravy over it.
mymeo0ghbx2xrIGoaG3JXQ,4,"If it wasn't so unhealthy I would come more often but even when I've eaten elsewhere, I often stop here for a teh tarik!"
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,0,How can you ignore these pastries.
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,1,Tai Sar Piah .
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,2,"also known as bean paste biscuits, similar to filfipino hoopia, except thinner."
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,3,This joint is a one of the best where I tasted these pastry.
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,4,It was done in very traditional way and they offer sweet and salty flavors.
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,5,A good snack on the go or for breakfast with coffee.
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,6,They are also cheap from SGD.60 to SGD.80.
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,7,Or you can buy it for 3 for SGD 1.00 .
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,8,Thats a deal.
oBjfu3RY8ZkiT5olsy85Tg,9,A must try in Singapore food scene and dont forget to take some with you.
U9K1SPsiuBmhcVQMmkpsJg,0,"Perfect late night food - greasy, spicy, cheap and quick!!"
U9K1SPsiuBmhcVQMmkpsJg,1,Wish there was a joint like this is San Francisco.
U9K1SPsiuBmhcVQMmkpsJg,2,"We had masala dosa, masala chai and plain parota - total bill $6.50 - beat that!"
dwG40X-oEvhC3wuhBKOM9g,0,Really tasty Indian and mamak food right next to Mustafa.
dwG40X-oEvhC3wuhBKOM9g,1,"The location also means you might pay slightly more for food, but this really only means $0.50 - $1 so the food is still great value."
dwG40X-oEvhC3wuhBKOM9g,2,We had a mutton set meal and a fish set meal.
dwG40X-oEvhC3wuhBKOM9g,3,Both portions were very generous and the fish was not as dry as you'd find in some places.
dwG40X-oEvhC3wuhBKOM9g,4,We asked for extra papadum and they obliged at no extra cost.
dwG40X-oEvhC3wuhBKOM9g,5,A big meal will cost you around $8-$9 per person here.
eOVFahYIWPWiO9djBcSWJA,0,"This used to be one of my favourite local curry puff brands, but like so many other popular brands, the skin tends to be doughy and oily instead of dry, crisp, and light."
eOVFahYIWPWiO9djBcSWJA,1,The curry potato chicken filling is still of very good quality and flavour and worthy of 4-5 stars but the skin is an essential part and really disappoints and bring the whole rating down :-(
87yubMAHLqiW53TbxQ0IeQ,0,"Coming from America, I thoroughly enjoyed this!"
87yubMAHLqiW53TbxQ0IeQ,1,This was also the only exciting place in the entire terminal which was a little disappointing.
87yubMAHLqiW53TbxQ0IeQ,2,Curry Laksa was delicious and they added some extra spicy sauce which was the cherry on top.
87yubMAHLqiW53TbxQ0IeQ,3,"Also, service was good!"
87yubMAHLqiW53TbxQ0IeQ,4,I usually expect some eye rolls and rude tone because I'm not a native.
87yubMAHLqiW53TbxQ0IeQ,5,"Only thing, wish their chicken was crispy"
5qnT_Tu2WrEgyDgmhfH6nw,0,"I was looking for a light snack before my flight and I love curry puffs, so happy that I found this place!"
5qnT_Tu2WrEgyDgmhfH6nw,1,Their curry puffs are the best!
5qnT_Tu2WrEgyDgmhfH6nw,2,My favorite was the salty egg and beef rendang.
5qnT_Tu2WrEgyDgmhfH6nw,3,They were all good actually.
5qnT_Tu2WrEgyDgmhfH6nw,4,Not too bad price wise too!
5qnT_Tu2WrEgyDgmhfH6nw,5,I recommend buying a few before your flight and then some extra for your flight incase you get hungry.
5qnT_Tu2WrEgyDgmhfH6nw,6,I munched on these from my flight from Singapore to Japan to LA.
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,0,"I have read slightly about Curry Times but never did I know that it is run by the our famous curry puff brand, Old Chang Kee."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,1,"I have always enjoyed the Old Chang Kee's curry puffs more so than Mackenzie's or Rolina's, not because of the pastry skin but it's spicy curry filling with a fiery kick."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,2,But do not expect the same degree of heatiness from the Signature Curry Chicken ($7.90) here.
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,3,"Designated as a healthier curry, this was made with fresh milk, not coconut milk."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,4,"Yet the consistency is not lost, creamy and fragrant with spices."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,5,"The tender flesh of the chicken drumstick added galore to simplicity, making this a comforting bowl to go with the traditional old-school Chinese ""baguette""."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,6,"In fact, one can have the curry along with rice or prata."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,7,"I was impressed by the hand-pressed Prata, which is crispy, light and airy."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,8,"I thought it heard the ""Pa-Pa"" sound just like its Chinese name æ´¾æ´¾é¥¼ as I teared apart the layers with ease."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,9,"I wanted something sweet but the Butter and Sugar ($1.90) was not an ideal choice for the slab of butter disintegrated into a pool of yellow oil in few seconds, not quite different from eating prata with oil."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,10,The Sambal Petai ($6.90) sets itself apart from the usual as one can taste the gritty bits of Hae Bee in the chilli paste.
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,11,Perfect to go with a bowl of rice.
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,12,"The Crispy Fish Cutlet Rice was delicious too; tender moist fish encased in a thin, golden-crisp shell."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,13,The curry is served separately in another bowl thus non-spicy eaters can dig in without worry.
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,14,MUST TRY Buns!!
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,15,The buns made freshly in house are perhaps the softest buns I've ever had.
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,16,"Struggling to carry the heavy filings, the dome-shaped virtually collapsed and lost its shape the moment it was split into halves to reveal the filling, an indication of delicateness and the sheer amount of filling."
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,17,The curry version wasn't spicy too and the coconut version was aromatic but too sweet.
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,18,And the ending for a curry-licious meal?
UXzS4n5VTVMWLRhKgVlocg,19,Traditionally Asian style desserts of chendol and bur bur cha cha.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,0,"Thanks to an article shared on social media recently, this place was made known."
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,1,Hawker fares and great food are what Punggol residents have been yearning for for years.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,2,There is no centralized hawker centers but scattered coffee shops and food court all over made tracking good food difficult.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,3,"However, this Hokkien is a pure delight to residents here."
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,4,It is prepared by the distinct looking 70 year old uncle.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,5,Kudos to him because opening hours start from 11am to 11pm.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,6,He takes a break between 2-5pm.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,7,"It's no easy feat, plus it's opened on most days of the week."
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,8,This hokkien mee is sure not to be missed if you like the wetter version.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,9,"This is really wet, stock is really flavorful and it really combines very well with the noodles."
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,10,"The wok hei (wok taste) is also very much apparent, yet not overpowering (which could make it tastes like chao tah (burned)."
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,11,Very light and comforting wok hei.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,12,That takes skills man!
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,13,Chilli is the light orange kind of color.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,14,"I'm not sure if they make their own chilli or get it from a supplier, but the chilli is well made, well blended to the noodles and has a kick."
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,15,"The lime, the chilli and the noodles are a very good combination."
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,16,Queues can be long on the weekends and during lunch.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,17,Do try it after 7pm or for a supper.
eyVWPY0ux_zSR4-8-nXAhw,18,The let down is probably the food court's ventilation isn't very good and it can get pretty stuffy even in the night.
NJ-ySVmjWymqI2hlR9jZ1Q,0,"This is pretty near my place an usually after football on Sundays, I'll drop by Alina's for lunch before heading home."
NJ-ySVmjWymqI2hlR9jZ1Q,1,The food is what draws me back there almost every week.
NJ-ySVmjWymqI2hlR9jZ1Q,2,"They serve nasi padang, seafood and prata as well."
NJ-ySVmjWymqI2hlR9jZ1Q,3,Some of the dishes I usually order are the beef rendang and curry chicken.
NJ-ySVmjWymqI2hlR9jZ1Q,4,The service there is also pretty good.
NJ-ySVmjWymqI2hlR9jZ1Q,5,I would recommend this place for quick and affordable lunches/dinners if you;re around the bedok south area and craving some decent malay food.
eHtXhfUCgoU-QZXo4G6Juw,0,This is a great place to have late meals.
eHtXhfUCgoU-QZXo4G6Juw,1,"As far as I know it never closes, so be it after a night out, a sports match, or if your simply feeling peckish at home, this is a great place for you!"
eHtXhfUCgoU-QZXo4G6Juw,2,"For those residing in the East, Alina's Kitchen is conveniently located on Bedok South Avenue 3."
eHtXhfUCgoU-QZXo4G6Juw,3,The Roti Prata comes at very reasonable prices and is of the best quality.
eHtXhfUCgoU-QZXo4G6Juw,4,"The service is great as well, very friendly people!"
eHtXhfUCgoU-QZXo4G6Juw,5,"If you come late enough you will be able to park your car just on the side of the road, the Traffic Police won't bother you at all."
eHtXhfUCgoU-QZXo4G6Juw,6,"Its a nice atmosphere, a very light ambiance, fantastic for a quick meal, or hang out with friends."
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,0,Discovered this place whenever I was having supper around the area.
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,1,I was passing-by and saw a banner saying drinks at a low price.
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,2,"One day (2 months later), I decided to give this pace a try."
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,3,"What the banner says was really true, low priced drinks."
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,4,3 Heineken for S$13.
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,5,Certain bottled liquors were cheaper then most places.
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,6,Look at the drink/wine list for the prices.
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,7,Food wise were quite good.
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,8,But I was there for their cheap drinks....
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,9,The staff are friendly & quite attentive.
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,10,"Overall, it's a good place to chill out without burning a hole in the wallet."
R3KZHtWaHhlaLygTDIbw7A,11,Definitely will drop by next time.
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,0,Peck is a sort of gourmet bakery in the heart of the city with very affordable prices for very good snacks.
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,1,"There's a lot on show, but there are always a few I go back to."
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,2,My favourite would be a ciabatta filled with bacon and cheese.
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,3,"The bun is crispy on the outside yet pillow soft on the inside, and we all know what combination bacon and cheese is."
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,4,"The slight chewiness of the bacon adds a great contrast in texture too, making this a good bite at all times, with a size large enough to have for breakfast (which I do on many occasions - it still tastes great the morning after if you run it through the oven)."
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,5,"Another undeniably good item is their peach pastry, the pastry having a perfectly crisp croissant-like texture, the custard and peach combination again a winning one, despite not being outstanding."
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,6,A most delicious fruit pastry if I've ever had one.
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,7,"I've also had their calzone with sausage and mushrooms and peppers in it, which is very hearty and filling - they are very generous with their ingredients - but I'm not the biggest fan of peppers, and the calzone for me tastes a little too chewy for my liking, especially when you don't pick this up fresh from the oven."
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,8,"Overall, such good value!!"
gQZ8rNRMiv_AeAVLDN7-Nw,9,!
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,0,"Just like all the other BreadTalks, but it's a refreshingly cheap option for i12 Katong Mall."
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,1,"In a place where most things are pricey, and a bit fancier and upmarket than Katong is used to, BreadTalk keeps things casual."
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,2,You can tell by the pretty long queues that Katong people are all just heartlanders by heart; we don't need to fancy malls or expensive pastries found throughout the mall.
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,3,I like how BreadTalk is one of the first things that you encounter when you head into the main entrance.
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,4,It's just where Awfully Chocolate used to be before all the renovation took place!
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,5,"Of course, as with all BreadTalks there are always new things with strange, funny names for a couple of bucks; it's no different here."
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,6,"There's quite a bit to explore on Katong Mall so grab a bun of sorts on your way in and go explore the rest of the mall, laughing at how you're eating for cheaper than everyone else."
XoaNimWcRGbFbuvEsO4pTw,7,:P
7316cBfnqF8rKvXkf0qgLg,0,think this bakery deserves 4 star since i like it so much i had it 3 days in a row!

7316cBfnqF8rKvXkf0qgLg,2,order and go.
7316cBfnqF8rKvXkf0qgLg,3,"e loaf of white bread i had was really soft and with every bite, keeps you wanting more BUT its only as good as it taste for about 24 hours."

8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,0,"SwissBake is founded by a true Swiss Mr Xavier Baumgartner who has been a pastry chef for more than 30 years, winning numerous awards in his pursuit of culinary excellence."
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,1,"A couple of years later there are now more than 20 cafes, retail outlets and bread corners across Singapore."
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,2,"Bread Corners are always located within a Cold Storage and this one is located in the Holland Village Cold Storage, you can miss it because it's right next to the entrance."
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,3,"They have a large variety of pastries (my favorite is the apricot croissant), breads and a few cakes."
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,4,You can also order cakes from them if the selection doesn't suit you.
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,5,Swissbake is really the only place to buy good european bread in Holland Village.
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,6,They are freshly baked in the morning and if you come early they are still warm.
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,7,Baguette's they back throughout the day.
8Ks2-lHLwXlnfOcTuinQIg,8,At the end of the day most breads go on discount.
z7F2DQ79ywVZByT7fWGZkA,0,"Vegetarian bakery in Fortune Centre, with a wide range of freshly baked breads, cakes, cookies."
z7F2DQ79ywVZByT7fWGZkA,1,I like how everything is marked if it has eggs in it (or not).
z7F2DQ79ywVZByT7fWGZkA,2,Items with cheese are self-explanatory.
z7F2DQ79ywVZByT7fWGZkA,3,I don't like their cakes because I bought a slab of banana cake here and found it to be chock-full of banana flavoring.
z7F2DQ79ywVZByT7fWGZkA,4,"I do however love their pumpkin buns, made with pumpkin bread and pumpkin mash without any added sugar."
z7F2DQ79ywVZByT7fWGZkA,5,"This bakery is for people who are vegetarian not for health reasons, but perhaps religion reasons."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,0,"After having dinner, my friends and i wanted to hang out more."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,1,So we went to plaza singapura to search for dessert.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,2,We came upon Ji De Chi.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,3,"As there is 7 of us, we waited quite long for the seat."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,4,We placed our order and dessert is served shortly.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,5,I ordered mango strawberry flavour snow ice.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,6,It does not reflect the image in the menu.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,7,Tasted pretty alright.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,8,"My friend ordered mocca flavour, and to my surprised, it was way better than what i expected from it."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,9,"When we were eating halfway, waitress came and hurry us off."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,10,She said they were closing.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,11,We were pretty upset over it.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,12,How does she expect us to finish our dessert 10mins.
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,13,"Moment later, another waitress came over and asked us to finish off our dessert."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,14,"In the first place, the waitress should have warned us about the closing time."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,15,"If not, we won't enter into the dessert stall."
cqqz-jkAT6_rQnZUA6MdsQ,16,"Afterall, this is rather a bad experience for me."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,0,Fish & Co has been in Singapore for as long as I can remember.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,1,"But haven't been back since my college days, when we would go to the Fish & Co glasshouse!"
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,2,"They have expanded their menu to cater to the health conscious, they even have a menu for 500 calories and under!"
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,3,"They jumped on the ""high-tech"" wagon and now hand customers an iPad so that the customers do the ordering themselves."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,4,"Sadly, as someone who is familiar with UX best practicies."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,5,This user-interface needs some work.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,6,"It requires alot of drill down to get your specific order done and the only way to get back to the main menu, is to drill back up."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,7,"The table we were seated at was meant for 12 and it was a square shaped, rather a long table whereby people on both ends can't even see each other."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,8,"For a weekday lunch hour, it wasn't packed, in fact, it wasn't even half full, in comparison to swensens on the other side of NEX, which would have a snaking queue outside."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,9,Both serve similar western fares for about $20 (after GST + service charge) with main course and ice cream desserts.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,10,1.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,11,"Grilled White Fish with Ebiko $16.95++ Instead of the typical fried fish and chips, I tried to go with something ""healthier"", or at least I was convincing myself that it was indeed healthier."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,12,"The fish tasted okay, nothing special."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,13,"The grilled cheesey topping with the ebiko was nice, although the ebiko had a dark orange exterior and was definitely frozen for a long time."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,14,The sides were beancurd and coleslaw.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,15,I loved the coleslaw as it had raisins in it!
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,16,I was very full from this main course alone!
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,17,2.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,18,"Clam Chowder soup Somehow they forgot to serve everyone their soup, so after I was done with my main course, they served me the soup."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,19,Which I barely finished.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,20,"It was thick, didn't taste like it was straight out of a can."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,21,"Nothing great, nothing bad."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,22,3.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,23,Tiramisu ice cream I was almost at my limit after the soup and here comes the ice cream!
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,24,"There was only one flavour, tiramisu."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,25,It had nuts in it and it tasted like the normal king's ice cream.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,26,"The lunch menu also came with a drink which I had an earl grey tea, you can pick fizzy drinks as well."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,27,Now I know why people flock to swensen's for lunch instead.
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,28,"You get so much more value there, especially if you order a sundae."
od_n_uS_noiPCqUndjzh-g,29,"However, here at Fish & Co, you do get a drink and a soup as well."
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,0,"If you are a roti prata lover and have been searching for healthier prata, this is it!"
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,1,The prata chef does not add extra oil into the making of the prata and he does not fry it.
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,2,He toast it until it's cooked.
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,3,So it's not oily when you eat them.
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,4,And they are so delicious!
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,5,The dal & curry sauce are yummy!
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,6,And you have to try their vadai (Indian donut).
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,7,"They are super yummy - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and yes, not oily too!!"
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,8,I don't feel that I need a major workout after eating it!
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,9,"Most of all, the couple that works on their food are super friendly and helpful."
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,10,The chef took his time to explain how he made it such that his food are healthy and not oily.
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,11,I'm definitely bringing more friends there!
7DPLF6gcf7-dcYRNOp6DNA,12,!
9IMTSlPoElwG3zW-Y4nBMQ,0,Hairloom de Jardin is a unique two-in-one shop - with one side being a cafe (Cafe de Jardin) and the other side being a hairdressing saloon (Hairloom de Jardin).
9IMTSlPoElwG3zW-Y4nBMQ,1,"While I have yet to patronize the saloon, I love the decor of the cafe."
9IMTSlPoElwG3zW-Y4nBMQ,2,The whole place is filled with an eclectic mix of furniture and accessories - very Alice in Wonderland Tea Party kind of feeling.
9IMTSlPoElwG3zW-Y4nBMQ,3,"They sell mainly cafe food: pasta, salads, sandwiches and drinks (both hot and cold)."
9IMTSlPoElwG3zW-Y4nBMQ,4,The food is nothing spectacular although edible.
9IMTSlPoElwG3zW-Y4nBMQ,5,I do quite like their yakult soda drink though.
9IMTSlPoElwG3zW-Y4nBMQ,6,"Go for the atmosphere, not for the food."

inyy3bh6pcZpigmp7tqy9w,0,I love these Chinese desserts.must try whenever you are in town.
inyy3bh6pcZpigmp7tqy9w,1,Located almost everywhere.
inyy3bh6pcZpigmp7tqy9w,2,The mango w sago is popular.Not too sweet and made just right.
7BV3B00a4liWuV10xUQ9NQ,0,Um.
7BV3B00a4liWuV10xUQ9NQ,1,Supposed to be an icy soup not just completely frozen.
7BV3B00a4liWuV10xUQ9NQ,2,Even the ice cream seems icy like it's been sitting in a freezer for a long time.
7BV3B00a4liWuV10xUQ9NQ,3,This particular location is not up to the usual standards.
7BV3B00a4liWuV10xUQ9NQ,4,The staff doesn't understand me.
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,0,Bengawan Solo at Nex offers some local dessert treats as well as some lovely cream cakes.
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,1,"Although staff here always seems ""busy"" and queues might be a little long sometimes, they sure make some decent tasting kuehs."
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,2,"The Bingka Ubi (Baked Tapioca) is soft yet chewy while the Talam Hijau boasts a nice blend of pandan, coconut milk and orange sugar."
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,3,"My favourites from Bengawan Solo are the kueh lapis, which come in plain, prune and cranberry."
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,4,Prune and cranberry are absolutely lovely mainly because I generally love both fruits.
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,5,The lapis cakes are really soft.
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,6,"Kuehs are generally not overtly sweet so if you're looking to fill your sweet tooth craving, try their cream cakes instead."
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,7,I love their mango and pandan kaya cakes.
nnk6Nc-QqVtGGmAGMSdnqQ,8,The former bursts with mango cream and small chunks of fruit while the latter further highlights just how tasty the marriage is between pandan and kaya.
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,0,"This store is in the canteen on 9th level of SKYTECH, Blk 2 Bukit Batok Industrial Park A building."
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,1,"The store used to be in Bukit Batok Community Centre, which now shifted to this place."
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,2,I only come here when I'm nearby this area and best is that they open everyday till 5pm.
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,3,What I most like about are their Roast Pork and Duck.
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,4,The roast porks' skin is roasted to a perfect crispy skin which you can hear the crunchiness while biting it.
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,5,"The meat has just the right thickness of lean meat, fat & skin...yummy to my liking."
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,6,"(If you are there late afternoon, they usually run out of the roast pork & Duck) I've not tried their Roast Duck yet, but looks delicious hanging at the glass casing."
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,7,"I will definitely come by when I'm craving for crispy pork... Oh yes, I forgot about their Char Siew.....it's so so only but still okay for a combo meat orders."
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,8,Burrppp...
6FyUBZunmCg24759VvJMvA,9,Cheers.
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,0,Asam Laksa has taken its spot over the Western Stall in West Coast Square.
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,1,It was kind of mix feelings as on one hand I was sad to hear that there are only 1 option left for western food but on the other hand I was quite happy to see this unique stall out there.
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,2,Asam Laksa is a chain stalls with staff in uniform.
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,3,Hygiene is well taken care of over here with friendly servers wearing hair net.
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,4,"Asam Laksa - $3.50 Noodles were thick and springy, soaking up the delicious gravy and made the bowl of Asam Laksa so appetizing."
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,5,Ingredients like pineapple and large chunks of fish were given in the serving.
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,6,"Apparently, there is only 1 standard size served at $3.50."
dQsF6aktgY0TMtaEZuw9Qw,7,Serving was small and it will be better if it was served in bigger size at the same cost.
qgW8GBdV3W2XxzqYhPlflQ,0,Nice tangy asam and soft slurppy noodles.
qgW8GBdV3W2XxzqYhPlflQ,1,"I like the tangy base, with the opinions and fresh veg it adds a dimension to noodles, like the way Vietnamese Pho brings to our local palate."
qgW8GBdV3W2XxzqYhPlflQ,2,Nice addition to the local scene.
HciTiESotKja7mYCjUnnCw,0,One of the best roasted pork noodles I have eaten in a hawker centre.
HciTiESotKja7mYCjUnnCw,1,The meat was fleshy and the noodles were cooked in Hong Kong style.
HciTiESotKja7mYCjUnnCw,2,"At $3.50 a plate, it was very value for money."
HciTiESotKja7mYCjUnnCw,3,There were plenty of condiments/sauces at the side so you could add as much or as little as you like.
HciTiESotKja7mYCjUnnCw,4,The char siew rice was not as great though.
HciTiESotKja7mYCjUnnCw,5,The char siew slices were rather hard.
HciTiESotKja7mYCjUnnCw,6,"Nevertheless, I would definitely return for the roasted pork noodles."

0bpFabrsCjAftSkVFp8VdA,4,It has generous amount of bean sprouts and smell of wok flavour.
0bpFabrsCjAftSkVFp8VdA,5,"Even though the portion is of right size to the price that I'm paying for, such delicacy is still addictive and leave me wanting for more when I have cleared the plate."
0bpFabrsCjAftSkVFp8VdA,6,"Food is cook upon order, thus ensure the freshness and heat on these scrumptious delights."
SwVHvpwqxQJoGlbyaU4uxQ,0,"Not the best kway chap around, but possible the only one around this neighborhood."
SwVHvpwqxQJoGlbyaU4uxQ,1,"The kway is not thin as the best out there, the meats not as flavorful."
SwVHvpwqxQJoGlbyaU4uxQ,2,It is ok only lah.
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,0,Andhra Curry is located next to Clover Springs at of the Comtech foodcourt on level 1 / basement / same level as the carpark.
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,1,"There are 2 Indian stalls at the Comtech, but this one is vegetarian and the other one is not."
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,2,That's about the only difference.
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,3,Comtech has a large indian working population and they form around 30% of the diners at the foodcourt.
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,4,"Since there are only 2 stalls and Indians do like to eat Indian food, you can guess the queues are pretty long."
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,5,"And because of the laid back Indian attitude they don't really move fast, but nobody cares, I guess that's a good thing :) People behind the counter are friendly and patient."
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,6,Plenty of choice of over 10 dishes and they never run out of something.
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,7,Sometimes you just crave for Indian flavors or having a large plate of biryani rice.
xz30xItYGjBn4maaJxfMaQ,8,They won't let you down.
_e5B3X6Vw1-q0rl3o2BMjw,0,The veggie somosas are great!
_e5B3X6Vw1-q0rl3o2BMjw,1,The molikofta is very good .
_e5B3X6Vw1-q0rl3o2BMjw,2,The saag paneer is boring and bland.
_e5B3X6Vw1-q0rl3o2BMjw,3,I Â have to give up on saag in this country.
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,0,"This stall is an extremely popular stall among the Indian, Chinese and Malay population in NTU despite it being an Indian stall."
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,1,"Their hot favorite is their naan, prata and biryani."
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,2,I actually enjoy all 3 dishes from them.
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,3,The curry is pretty standard and not too spicy.
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,4,"But if were to pick one of my favorite, I've got to say that it's the prata."
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,5,The prata is more of the soft and flaky type rather than the crispy type you see at Prata House (thomson).
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,6,"Queue wise, this stall has a really really long queue that extends even to the food stall behind."
bkOsCmKFpafLLXTqniiZ2g,7,"Their service is pretty fast as most of their food is already precooked (yes that includes their prata, so you have to be lucky to receive prata from a fresh batch)."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,0,I think this is the first time I've started a listing for a casual dining establishment because it was so...bad.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,1,"Without intellectualizing the whole rationale of starting a business, I am always supportive of small business owners, especially local ones trying out new concepts in Singapore."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,2,"I've yet to come across a savory waffle chain here and I do love a mean fried chicken and waffles from my days in Virginia; so when the dude said he saw a row of waffle pans as we were waiting for our soft shell crab po boy at another shop, we were game on."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,3,Well here's what happened.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,4,"First, there is nothing gourmet about the food at Griddy."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,5,The waffle batter is similar to the stuff you get at a cheap neighborhood bakery where the grouchy aunty splats on dollops of sweet peanut butter for $1.20.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,6,The fish fillet that was stuffed in my Ocean Catch sandwich was caught in the ocean via the delicious factory flash frozen route.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,7,"Just putting it out there because when I paid $5.90 for what I thought was gourmet fast food, I was left debating with the dude which part of our meal was refined."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,8,Now we are simple people.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,9,We ordered an Ocean Catch sandwich as mentioned and an ice lemon tea.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,10,"Going with the aforementioned theme, my tea came first and it was of the syrup variety."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,11,Our waffle arrived and I took the picture you see on this review.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,12,Sliced it in half and oh...the waffle wasn't cooked through.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,13,The batter was still mushy and was slopping onto the plate.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,14,We sent it back and pointed out the problem.
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,15,"The ""corrected"" sandwich arrived and I guess they solved the undercooked waffle problem...by really browning it on the outside?"
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,16,"When I sliced this sandwich in half, I realized the fish meat looked barely cooked in some sections."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,17,So what did I do with a sandwich I've already paid for and sent back once?
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,18,"I picked the wilted lettuce leaves out, ate the slices of tomato, bits of cooked fish and the waffle."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,19,"To conclude, this is really a quick service joint aimed at students who with too much pocket money and weened on corn syrup, with a kitchen run by students and no quality control."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,20,"If you ARE a student, I'd suggest going to Coronation plaza or something for fool proof excellent after school food."
0ykDLah14tngErVise0yVA,21,"Otherwise, we had far better food elsewhere in the area (Isetan, meticulously assembled (I wouldn't call 'em) po boys)."
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,0,"Ordered the Mix platter that came with bacon, chicken chop, beef patty, egg and waffle fries."
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,1,$14.90.
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,2,"Hawaiian waffle burger, $8.90."
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,3,Followed by blueberry cheesecake waffle as dessert.
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,4,$8.50.
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,5,"Blueberry cheesecake ice cream tastes so-so, no cheesecake texture/taste."
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,6,"The food was really good tho, except price didn't include GST and service charge so it summed up to be pretty pricey."
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,7,About $35 for 2.
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,8,Service was really nice and friendly!
Q-JzS_bznEQol0W_mecJzw,9,Pleasant trip!
BLL-WFIGsCSbvl77cQgPtA,0,Operated by the Select Catering people.
BLL-WFIGsCSbvl77cQgPtA,1,Decent edible fancy food?
BLL-WFIGsCSbvl77cQgPtA,2,"An attractive alternative for kids, probably looks good enough for IG."
BLL-WFIGsCSbvl77cQgPtA,3,"Taste average, quality average, pricing above average for average but interesting food."
BLL-WFIGsCSbvl77cQgPtA,4,"Ok to try, but I doubt anyone would fall in love."
BLL-WFIGsCSbvl77cQgPtA,5,Probably good ideas for trying variations at home.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,0,Not Too Greedy for Griddy's Griddy's really caught my eye when I first walked by.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,1,"Since waffle town, I haven't seen a restaurant fully dedicate itself to specializing in Waffles and fried chicken."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,2,"It's one of those comfort, sinful food that we've all heard in stereotypical Hollywood movies but after having a taste, you know what all the fuss is about."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,3,"Located at the basement of Westgate, Griddy was filled with students."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,4,Essentially because their price was pretty reasonable and the fact that it's the ultimate junk food.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,5,"Looking at the menu, I was excited by the local flair they added to it."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,6,"I imagined the sweetness of the waffles, mixed with the savory fried chicken, topped with its luscious sweet and salty laksa sauces."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,7,Unfortunately.......
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,8,It was all part of my imagination.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,9,Battered Chicken with Waffles topped with Â Laksa Sauce.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,10,It all tasted very one dimensional.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,11,The laksa sauce wasn't fragrant or sweet while the chicken was well...... A piece of fried chicken.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,12,"On top of that, the waffles lacked that crispiness and sweetness that we've all come to enjoy soon a whole, the dish didn't come quite come together for me."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,13,"It felt a lot like those great dishes you thought of when you were a kid, only to put it together and having it fall short of your expectations."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,14,Mid Wings with Salted Egg Sauce and Laksa sauce.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,15,"Sadly, another let down for us."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,16,"The midpoints were small, cooked till a little dry and while the laksa sauce was again lacking any form of a pinch, the salted egg sauce was an even bigger disappointment."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,17,"It was thin, lacking flavour and tasted like a yellow sauce with a hint of salted egg yolk in stead of being A SALTED EGG sauce."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,18,Spaghetti with Grilled chicken and salted egg sauce.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,19,This dish was well...... Meh.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,20,"Pasta a bit overcooked and blend, chicken was grilled beyond grilled and to top it off, it came with the same diluted salted egg sauce as the chicken wings."
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,21,Overall?
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,22,Highly disappointing.
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,23,If this was meant to be soul food made locals than....
r3kjC-zVuLwT9ARBDDVC6A,24,I'm afraid I may have just lost my soul.
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,0,This is the express dining version of the Sankranti Group of restaurants.
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,1,Most of the seating are outdoors and they only have a small kitchen for the preparation of food.
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,2,"Thus, do not expect the type of variety you have from the other Sankranti branches in Singapore."
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,3,"However, it is good enough for a nice meal - whether you are craving for naan, thosai or rice with a few dishes."
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,4,The restaurant serves mainly Southern Indian food and can be quite spicy for people with a weaker stomach who nonetheless love Indian food (like me).
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,5,"Their milk tea is also nicely done, and very good to calm a raging stomach (from the spiciness)."
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,6,"During lunch and dinner, be prepared to wait a bit for your food as they have limited manpower (I only saw max."
-nwJRkUFOqXRuRYuRkE_hQ,7,2 people preparing food at any one time).
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,0,PRICE: OKAY $4 each for the Mee Goreng & Nasi Goreng Ikan Bilis which is okay for me because the serving is quite large but there is no form of meat in the two dishes i ordered.
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,1,Drinks are pricey.
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,2,$2 for iced milo.
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,3,ATMOSPHERE: OKAY A little cramp because the tables are very close to one another and there a couple of flies here and there but otherwise okay.
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,4,FOOD: NOT BAD The portion was very filling and the food smelt really good & taste was great!
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,5,"Not alot of ingredients though, only vegetables, egg and the carbohydrate for the dish."
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,6,No fancy seafood / meat / fish.
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,7,OVERALL: OKAY Might come back if i feel like eating something different from what i usually eat.
jIer9apJf55nETMQIlOLOQ,8,But the queue during lunch time is long so do be prepared to wait about 20min for your food!
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,0,This is one of my favorite Indian eateries in Singapore.
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,1,I've tried multiple things on their menu and it's all good.
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,2,"The mutton curry is one of my favorites, served with the biryani."
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,3,"They are known for their prata, which is good, but they only serve it at certain hours of the day."
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,4,"The place can be a bit intimidating if you don't know what you're asking for, but the food is laid out in front of you, and the staff are very receptive to pointing."
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,5,"It's also the few places where I've walked in in Singapore, asked what they recommend, and get a very straight response."
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,6,Basically they just started piling my plate up with food.
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,7,"This place isn't fancy, but there are usually open tables, and it's air conditioned."
mv_DuOgRHIlIZzedfjsu_w,8,You can get a great meal and a drink for under $10.
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,0,This place is one of the few places that look clean and is air conditioned.
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,1,"However, the food is sub par at best."
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,2,"Got the dossa, it wasn't crispy and did not have much taste."
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,3,The 3 dipping sauces all tasted the same but were all different colors.
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,4,Maybe my palate isn't trained for it.
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,5,"The mango lassi was cool, creamy, and refreshing."
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,6,Service was nice and efficient.
ocLdTh0kjVQKvYWoFsb4-Q,7,The place accepts credit cards but it's a 20 dollar minimum.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,0,I was quite excited when one of my ex-colleague mentioned that there is a new eating place in Rail Mall that is worth a try out.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,1,Springleaf prata is tuck in the quiet corner of the mall facing the abandoned railway tracks.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,2,"I came to realize its existence recently even though it was opened since last Novemeber, serving an extensive, unique and delicious Indian Cuisine in its menu."
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,3,"In fact, this Halal Certified Indian food Chain has opened up one more food option to the Muslim pals staying nearby."
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,4,Drinks accompany our food will be none other than Teh O Limau Ice & Rose Syrup.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,5,"Teh-O-Liamau & Rose Syrup - $1.80 & $1.40 Being curious with alot of unfamiliar item out of the usual Indian Cuisine Menu, we ordered the Murtaburger which name sounds like Murtabak and Burger to me."
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,6,"2013 Murta Burger - $7 Taste was amazing and I only come to know about that this is actually a good marriage of prata with our well-liked ""Ramly Burger""."
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,7,"Ingredients include mutton patties, mayonnaise well hidden inside the usual squarish egg prata."
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,8,It was a moment of joy to see plenty of my favourite sticky mozzarella cheese while tearing up the prata.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,9,"Not only was it delicious, Â its crispiness of the prata had make me feel delighted."
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,10,Filling up part of our stomach with Maggie Goreng that looks plain and uninteresting.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,11,"Taste wise, it was nothing out of the ordinary but the dish came with generous chunks of chicken cooked together with eggs, beansprouts and vegetables, couple with cucumber and chilli as appetizer on the side."
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,12,Maggie Goreng with Chicken - $5 $1.10 for a piece of prata?
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,13,What's the market rate nowadays given for the price from a air-conditioned shop in a mall?
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,14,I bet this pricing is relatively acceptable especially when its plain prata is so crispy and goes well with the curry gravy.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,15,Yummy!
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,16,Plain Prata - $1.10 Service and food serving speed is acceptable.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,17,With a few well known prata places in the vicinity.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,18,the stood up among the rest with their specialties.
ck-K6xsIyIlkkNVa-LMobg,19,I forsee myself coming back for more.
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,0,Frolick is an yogurt ice cream stall.
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,1,"According to my friends, it's famous for having hot girls manning the counters at their store."
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,2,"Whether this is true or not, well, it's up to you to see and decide for yourself."
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,3,"For me, I was just there to try out their yogurt ice cream as I was looking for guilt-free ice cream to munch on.. and yogurt ice cream seems to be it."
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,4,One thing that put me off was the price of the ice cream.
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,5,"I gotta tell you, it's not exactly cheap (if you compare the price with say, Yami Yogurt which is $2.30 for the smallest cup).. even if you order the plain yogurt flavour."
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,6,Another issue I noted was that the ice cream melted pretty quickly...which was quite interesting since I was sitting in the stall munching on it.
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,7,"However, one thing I give it credit for is the concept of the stalls which is very adorable and the taste of the yogurt ice cream."
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,8,There is just something addictive about its taste that makes it stand out a little bit from other stores.. but I can't quite put my finger on it.
2KrtFmcZ7V_i7e1eHWLjSA,9,"Another thing that caught my attention was the adorable flowery marshmallows.. this was something new.. haha, definitely a store catered to ladies."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,0,Hee Kee Desserts has been in operations recently after a long renovation period.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,1,"Ever since her novelty (a few days back), it had been drawing curious consumers' attention like me."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,2,"Thus, I quickly fixed a date with my pals to check out his Hong Kong desserts together."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,3,Her interior design had displayed the style of a modern dessert cafe where you can find in Hong Kong.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,4,"Steamed Milk & bird-nest were seen as well, featuring those popular Hong kong Desserts."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,5,"Specializing in Hong Kong dessert, I would say that their variety is way lesser than its competitor which is located about 100m away, Ji De Chi (è®°å¾å)."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,6,"Perhaps the only starring item they had over them is its Custard Egg Yolk Rice Balls and Bird Nest Menu, other than that, the desserts items were very typical."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,7,Sesame paste was a total letdown.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,8,Firstly it was not warm enough then it was not that smooth and was rather watery.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,9,A vast difference from what we had expected.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,10,In the end we had almost the whole bowl left untouched.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,11,This had caught the person In-Charge's attention and she had confronted us to take our feedback.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,12,Service wise is still average and she had offered us for another bowl of dessert but we rejected.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,13,Sesame Paste - $3.80 Mango sago with pamelo is top in my dessert list whenever I see them in the menu.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,14,It was kind of disappointing when the pulps of pomelo tasted bitter and mango tasted raw.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,15,"Sweet taste is very lacking, it did not give the right punch into the stomach to someone who love such dessert."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,16,"Mango Sago with Pomelo - $4.50 Mango Sago with Pomelo and mango - $6.50 One of its signature desserts, Custard Egg Yolk Rice Ball in Osmanthus Soup."
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,17,Soup was not really warm with hints of ginger and Osmanthus smell was not very obvious or close to none.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,18,Liu Sha Tang Yuen in Osmanthus Soup (Hot) - $3.80 The combination of the mushiness from glutinous rice balls with the sandy texture of Custard Egg Yolk did not appeal to me.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,19,Perhaps this had marked my first and also the last trip to Hee Kee.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,20,The replacement of Lucky Dessert Stall to Hee Kee doesn't really turn things out well.
ZcqXtGWAE79F_3qHamMIsQ,21,Little Moo is going back to patronise Ji De Chi.
eShOadlW20Q79raqenbh_Q,0,GOOD AIRPORT FOOD This is a nice little sit-down restaurant.
eShOadlW20Q79raqenbh_Q,1,"I had the Salmon Bento Box and, I must say, it's one of the best I've ever had."
eShOadlW20Q79raqenbh_Q,2,Service - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Location - 4 stars Ambiance/Decor - 4 stars Don't leave a tip.
eShOadlW20Q79raqenbh_Q,3,They automatically add in 10%.
CEqFDLEDBlpmDl7IxD6DVg,0,"got this through my lounge membership and was blown away by the set meal, grilled fish."
CEqFDLEDBlpmDl7IxD6DVg,1,if you have the option just go here instead of another lounge.
CEqFDLEDBlpmDl7IxD6DVg,2,staff is good and food delivered.
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,0,"Nothing is worse than the feeling of utter regret as you're flying 40,000 feet above the ground after eating a greasy, fast-food meal."
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,1,"That's why when I'm traveling, I prefer to eat food that is as simple and as ""clean"" as possible."
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,2,"The Green Market, located on the 2nd floor of Terminal 2, fit the bill pretty well."
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,3,4/5 Ambience: The restaurant has a modern Japanese design that'll have Instagram gals/guys going gaga.
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,4,Eating there is also much more peaceful compared to the hubbub of the food court just down the hall.
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,5,"3.5/5 Food: My first time stopping by, I ordered the chicken donburi."
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,6,It didn't taste anything remotely Japanese.
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,7,It was more like a bland version of a Hong Kong chicken clay pot dish.
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,8,"My second time, I ordered the sashimi bento box and I liked that so much better."
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,9,"It came with 6 slices of sashimi, rice, miso soup, fruit, okra, and salad."
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,10,"Tbh, not the best sashimi I've had, but it was a simple and filling meal, so I left happy."
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,11,4/5 Service: Multi-lingual servers who are attentive but not intrusive.
YrGtL3huwHPTAxZjDN7keg,12,"Overall, definitely not the best Asian food I've ever had, but for airport food, it's not bad at all."
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,0,This is one of those moments I wish I had been boring.
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,1,I've been craving roti john from this place since coming here a couple of weeks back.
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,2,"It was crispy, bread was fresh, egg was fluffy and meat was tasty."
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,3,Yum...
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,4,"But then when I was about to order, I saw someone else's mutton chop, looking all glazy and rich... Mmm..."
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,5,I wish I had stayed on the straight and narrow because it was very mediocre.
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,6,I was tempted to reduce this review to three stars.
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,7,"But they're nice guys, and I haven't even tried their specialty yet - mee goreng."
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,8,So 4 stars for great roti john.
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,9,"Next time, I'll be flipping between mee goreng and roti john."
QSYkK6cr0Oq6cCuhyKfrHg,10,Damn.
VJiY8gSkU9GKOCUeefIKgA,0,This has recently become my fav place to eat!
VJiY8gSkU9GKOCUeefIKgA,1,Love their noodle and dim sum items.
VJiY8gSkU9GKOCUeefIKgA,2,Dessert is good too!!
VJiY8gSkU9GKOCUeefIKgA,3,Definitely something for everyone.
4MugDymxVEHkh4zzbHbdCw,0,"This is a chain dessert and HK style food casual restaurant, several outlets around Singapore."
4MugDymxVEHkh4zzbHbdCw,1,"It serves wanton noodles, braised meat rice, fried carrot cake, fried dumplings, liu sha bao (salted egg yolk custard bunds) etc for proper food/snack."
4MugDymxVEHkh4zzbHbdCw,2,"It also the traditional HK desserts such as mango pomelo sago, peanut cream, black sesame cream, almond cream, glutinous rice balls in ginger soup...."
4MugDymxVEHkh4zzbHbdCw,3,"I had the mango pomelo sago dessert which was refreshing and icy (shaved ice did not melt), perfect for a hot weather."
4MugDymxVEHkh4zzbHbdCw,4,The mango cubes hit the spot.
dy6qn2P4uwQxRek75Z2c3g,0,"Located at the end of Holland Village's main thoroughfare, Lorong Mambong, this particular branch of Coffee Club has a nice and relaxing ambience with mainly brown hues, and gives customers a choice of either the air-conditioned interior or outdoor al fresco area."
dy6qn2P4uwQxRek75Z2c3g,1,"I spend more than 2 hours here every time I visit, either chatting away with friends or chilling with a book."
dy6qn2P4uwQxRek75Z2c3g,2,"You can have your choice of coffee or tea here, but you definitely can't miss the dessert."
dy6qn2P4uwQxRek75Z2c3g,3,"There's a good selection of cakes, gigantic macarons, and pastries and they come in generous portions."
dy6qn2P4uwQxRek75Z2c3g,4,Those with a sweet tooth will love it.
dy6qn2P4uwQxRek75Z2c3g,5,"You can order main courses too, but I'm not a fan of the food at coffee houses."
dy6qn2P4uwQxRek75Z2c3g,6,"It probably won't be bad, but if you're in the area you might as well check out the other bars and restaurant in Holland Village."
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,0,We walked through the mall after lunch to get to the other side of the street so we can get picked up by the company shuttle.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,1,We walked by this fried food heaven and I couldn't help but salivate.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,2,"My colleague from Singapore, Linda said if I like spicy food then the potato puff is a must try."
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,3,Looked in my wallet.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,4,I have cash.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,5,Yes!!!
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,6,I ordered 1 but I should have ordered 2.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,7,Think of a super spicy pork empanada or wonton-shaped Hot Pocket.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,8,"Hmmm, I haven't had a hot pocket in years but yeah.. if you cannot handle spicy then this item is not for you."
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,9,The potato and pork was purÃ©ed and I can see some bits of carrots in them.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,10,"I don't know what they used to make the shell red (food color, I am assuming) but overall this satisfied my hunger cravings and I was left wanting water and more."
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,11,It was spicy.
FGkkkgoiKwZfPDPxHJsJ7g,12,Definitely something I am looking to replicate at home.
y2Ws_TPuE0iJ02xzvZgtEQ,0,This place is legit for muffin lovers.
y2Ws_TPuE0iJ02xzvZgtEQ,1,"If not, this place will win you over."
y2Ws_TPuE0iJ02xzvZgtEQ,2,"As the store name eludes to, Muf Muf specializes in freshly baked muffins."
y2Ws_TPuE0iJ02xzvZgtEQ,3,"They offer an enriching variety of muffins in terms of size (regular or mini) and flavors (i.e., sweet, savory, healthy, etc.)."
y2Ws_TPuE0iJ02xzvZgtEQ,4,"Muffins are their core products but if you're in the mood for cheesecakes, they have a limited offerings of mini-cheesecake pans (think Chinese egg tarts)."
y2Ws_TPuE0iJ02xzvZgtEQ,5,Have not tried the cheesecakes but the muffins are delicious in flavor and texture.
y2Ws_TPuE0iJ02xzvZgtEQ,6,Moist and yummy muffin tops making them great with a glass of milk or cup of Joe.
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,0,"I grew up in the east, not far away from this shop, and my mom used to bring me here every now and then when she had to bake a cake."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,1,Their comprehensive array of items is probably the reason I was infatuated with baking and became a pastry chef.
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,2,"The shop is quite small, but they've maximised the space very well."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,3,"You can find things on display, literally, everywhere."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,4,As you walk in you'll see pretty cupcake and soufflÃ© cases above you.
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,5,They have everything from dry ingredients to sugar work tools and even favour packaging supplies.
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,6,"They take up two units, but only one is fully accessible to customers - part of the other is used for storage."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,7,Don't expect neat shelves of goods in this shop.
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,8,"While most of the things are displayed prominently, you may have to dig a little deeper if you're looking for tools, tins or utensils."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,9,"If you want something specific, ask for help."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,10,"If you're not looking for anything specific, decide on something specific and ask for help."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,11,"You could probably get some goods cheaper here in comparison to the supermarket, but bear in mind this is a speciality shop so some prices are steep."
7wz2ss8NEdJn5gfZ9Mx3mA,12,"Generally, they charge more than Phoon Huat (baking-supplies chain with stores around the island) by a few ten cents."
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,0,Creations cafÃ© is a small yet cosy cafÃ© situated in the first level of Shaw Towers.
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,1,I have been patronizing this cafÃ© since 2008 and i would strongly recommend all pasta lovers to try their pasta selection.
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,2,Their pasta selections ranges from the tomato based to the creamy based.
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,3,I personally do not take cream and can't comment much on that.
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,4,"However, one seafood marinara is already enough to keep me coming back for years!"
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,5,"The seafood that they use are all very fresh and includes salmon, scallops and mussel."
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,6,"Of course, choose your favourite pasta type to go with it."
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,7,"For me, I definitely love their linguini the most."
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,8,The pricing of their menu is also considered value for money.
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,9,"They serve set lunches (which comes with a main dish, a bowl of delicious soup & a drink of your choice) at $10.50 and dinner (with an additional dessert) at $15.90."
Dd6CKuTpN72NrpOm8n-mSQ,10,"However, do avoid the busy lunch hours as you might have to wait 15-30mins to get a seat."
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,0,I didn't know about this place until a fellow Yelper mentioned about it.
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,1,"As a busy person, I have no time to explore new places, and usually if I do, I spent my time overseas so since this came in my discussion with the other two Yelpers, we decided to try out this place."
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,2,This cafe is located at Shaw Leisure Gallery - I have no idea of this location until that day and you can find it easily as it's located near the entrance.
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,3,There were a few vacant tables so we were lucky to get a place.
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,4,"We ordered set meals which consists of a soup, drink and our main course."
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,5,"I had the Chicken Curry pasta and to be honest, it was average, I tasted better ones elsewhere."
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,6,"As for the soup and garlic, I didn't like it."
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,7,"So overall, I find this to be average, I can't give this more than 3 stars, I would give this 2 and a half stars if it's possible."
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,8,"As for the service, it was ok."
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,9,Slow due to manpower shortage but the staff were polite.
ABbfjSPoslRO38f_9AryQw,10,"Overall, nothing to shout about."
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,0,"Located at Shaw Towers, it is another food place you can drop by before heading to Tom's Palette."
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,1,Came here with two Yelpers and we each ordered set A (drink + soup).
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,2,"The three interesting dishes' flavors on the menu are seafood laksa cream sauce, chicken java curry sauce and seafood thai cream sauce?"
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,3,"(need to double check) and we have to choose the pasta types (Spaghetti, Linguine, Rotini)."
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,4,"You could also choose the drinks (lemon tea, sodas, etc)."
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,5,"After deciding on what each one of us wanted to try, we filled up our orders on a paper-based menu."
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,6,The drinks came first then our foods and lastly our respective orders.
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,7,Our orders came switched.
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,8,I wanted to order rotini with seafood thai cream sauce but it ended up with linguine.
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,9,Portion came bigger than expected for a reasonable price.
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,10,"Verdict, among the three dishes I tried, I enjoyed what I ordered more."
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,11,The cream was lighter and it has the spicy and sour flavors in it.
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,12,"Overall, I am glad that one of the Yelper recommended this place."
A6lY5bTBetWXaQfg8ufNrw,13,Affordable pricing and generous portion is getting rarer these days :)
oX8dDHmhm-54-xT7LLX3xA,0,"As of May 2016, the Vivocity branch is having a promotion of $5 for each slice of cake."
oX8dDHmhm-54-xT7LLX3xA,1,I got the strawberry shortcake.
oX8dDHmhm-54-xT7LLX3xA,2,The cake box was very pretty.
oX8dDHmhm-54-xT7LLX3xA,3,The cake had fresh cream and just the right amount not to be overwhelming.
oX8dDHmhm-54-xT7LLX3xA,4,The sweetness was also just right and the strawberries were fresh.
oX8dDHmhm-54-xT7LLX3xA,5,"I would be interested to try out the other cakes in future, if they taste as good as they look!"
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,0,"Now this, is my absolute favourite store for mooncakes during the mid-autumn festival season."
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,1,"Having ordered this for more than 16 years consecutively (and still counting), I can vouch that the taste, quality and even size of the mooncakes remain largely consistent throughout the years."
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,2,"The mooncakes come in traditional packaging of a plain white cardboard box with"" (Tai Tong) printed in red on it."
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,3,None of those fancy artsy-fartsy designs that we see nowadays.
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,4,"I know it may not be the best reasoning, but I like to think that the best stuff always come in the most basic of packaging."
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,5,Simply because they spend less on the gimmicks and more on the ingredients.
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,6,"Once you sink your teeth into these mooncakes, you'll definitely know that it is really authentic and quality food."
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,7,"The lotus paste is smooth and silky, so thick that it appears to be slightly chewy."
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,8,It provides an interesting texture that is a joy to chew and consume.
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,9,The baked skin is a rich brown that is thin yet strong enough to hold in the fillings and retain its shape.
F8nGHSE-UgVr6DAbn0iYiQ,10,"The flavours become more distinct and fragrant the more you chew it, and sometimes, I leave the skin for last just so I can slowly savour its goodness."
lgDAtQ1c5wQ_Am-mbyyb-w,0,"After a hard day of shopping groceries and thinking about the cooking that has to be done once they get home, a lot of housewives and house husbands could not resist the temptation to take a breather at this small dessert shop."
lgDAtQ1c5wQ_Am-mbyyb-w,1,"They sell both traditional desserts like peanut soup, almond paste, tang yuan, etc and more innovative shaved ice dishes to appeal to the younger crowd."
lgDAtQ1c5wQ_Am-mbyyb-w,2,They also have a small selection of traditional dim sum for those who are hungrier.
lgDAtQ1c5wQ_Am-mbyyb-w,3,"A nice, unpretentious place for afternoon tea and a nice chat with friends."
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,0,I had a taste of some soya food at a store called 'Jollibean' namely soya milk and pancakes.
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,1,"Too bad, no soya jellybeans were in sight for me to sample but 'Jollibean' is usually known for its rich flavoured soya milk drinks."
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,2,The pancakes were delicious filled with peanuts and chocolate but no different from any other similar pancakes sold by competitors.
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,3,"However, its soya milk seemed to be richer in taste unlike the diluted version found in neighbourhood drink stalls but on par with the ones from Mr Bean."
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,4,"In any case, its drink served as good thirst quenchers especially for me being a soya milk fan since young."
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,5,"However, I have cut back on its consumption recently due to some recent studies found."
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,6,"Nevertheless, I do like to drink Jollibean soya drink on some occasion in moderation."
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,7,It's noteworthy that more food choices are available in Jollibean store than before.
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,8,I just hope that soya jellybeans are included as well to commemorate their namesake!
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,9,"Then again, soya flavoured jellybeans may not be anyone's palate."
mu6aqJzbxD7fmyHekS6Fbg,10,Jollibean's opening hours: 11am to 9pm.
72Rad_1Coeb143zBKrQ_ww,0,It is ok.
72Rad_1Coeb143zBKrQ_ww,1,Typical food court standard at best.
72Rad_1Coeb143zBKrQ_ww,2,It gets quite busy at lunch time but I suspect it is because there is no fish soup choices anywhere around here.
72Rad_1Coeb143zBKrQ_ww,3,"Ample seating, so that is a plus."
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,0,Confession: I'm a durian addict.
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,1,"Despite Singapore's humid temperament, I can't help but indulge in the King of Fruit ever so often."
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,2,Imagine my excitement when I saw Four Seasons Durians located on Level 3 at Nex.
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,3,"Unfortunately, my hopes of getting a good Durian fix were extinguished far too soon."
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,4,"Although the Durian Pancakes were reasonably packed with fresh Durian mix, the other products such as Durian Puff and Durian Crepe were mediocre at best."
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,5,"(Of course when it comes to Durian crepes, nothing beats Angie The Choice's thick and generously filled Durian rolls!)"
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,6,"Most disappointing of all from Four Seasons Durians had to be the Durian Mochi, which came in a box of 4 pieces."
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,7,"The Mochi skin was somewhat tasteless and stiff, with a bland Durian filling that made it almost impossible to enjoy."
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,8,Four Seasons Durian is not the best Durian food stall out there but at least prices are not too steep.
M-D_O4qQU1ou5cM1hwuqmA,9,Durian lovers could definitely settle for better!
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,0,"Located in East Point Mall, Curry Hopper immediately stands out because of its clean, bright look amidst the more homey feel of the rest of the mall."
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,1,"A good crowd can be found on most nights, although it is probably novelty more than anything else that keeps people coming; the East is the perfect place for better, cheaper options of the same cuisine."
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,2,"The menu isn't very extensive, and unlike most Indian restaurants, vegetarian options are not immediately apparent."
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,3,"A quick check with the staff reveals that they often get requests for vegetarian options, which they easily provide."
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,4,The Mee Goreng with veggies and tofu is a good option; a generous serving of red chilli and lime add that zing to an already tasty dish.
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,5,"Other options like prata and other Indian breads, however, are way too overpriced."
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,6,"I'm not paying $6 for a prata, and I'm certainly not doing it in the East."
7mwcJQvxrzCuVDzuzH21hw,7,"It might be worth checking out if you're looking for creative, meat-based Indian fusion."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,0,The selection and variety of coffee here always leaves me spoilt for choice.
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,1,"From Tarte Tatin Latte to Choco Stout Royale and more, it really leaves you lingering and wanting to try all those delicious flavours."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,2,"It is awesome that they keep their menu constantly updated, by introducing new food/drinks to the menu."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,3,"For starters, I would recommend New England clam chowder or the Hearty Clam soup."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,4,The mains are equally satisfying.
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,5,My favourite of them all is the Mentaiko spaghetti with salmon tataki ($20.50).
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,6,"The sunny side up egg is perfectly paired with the salmon which is slightly seared, yet partially raw for the added oompf."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,7,Further the sauce has bits of white roe and is tastefully tossed together with a sauce that is balanced with the right amount of savouriness to keep you wanting more.
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,8,"If you like your food slightly spicy, you'll fall in love with the Baby Crayfish Spaghetti!"
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,9,The sauce which has little green balls that taste like the mini roe you get in sushi sometimes is skillfully mixed with the mildly spicy sauce.
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,10,The crayfish is bite sized - it looks like prawns but tastes like crayfish - and makes it very enjoyable to feast on.
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,11,"As for desserts, they are all so prettily done that I don't even have the heart to eat them anymore."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,12,"What I love about the TCC joints is the comfortable environment to just have a good, decently priced meal."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,13,"With such a wide selection of food and beverages, I totally understand they are able to keep their regular customers coming back for more."
ffeia8uETSddqwXtOZmg3A,14,"TCC often has promotions such as 1-for-1 set meals, so keep your eyes peeled for that."
D-t2GL0KkgJw6w6Hh0deFQ,0,"If you ask me about this place, I personally feel that with the amount you pay for the meals, somewhere else is much better."
D-t2GL0KkgJw6w6Hh0deFQ,1,Why?
D-t2GL0KkgJw6w6Hh0deFQ,2,Because my salmon sandwich which was around $15 excluding GST was quite meager.
D-t2GL0KkgJw6w6Hh0deFQ,3,It only took up like 1/3 of the plate and the other 1/3 was vegetables.. that was it.
D-t2GL0KkgJw6w6Hh0deFQ,4,"Drinks wise, Â their smoothies are not that bad."
D-t2GL0KkgJw6w6Hh0deFQ,5,Service for me was quite slow that day as well.
D-t2GL0KkgJw6w6Hh0deFQ,6,"Other than that, if given the option, I don't think I will go back for their main courses.. if any, probably just go back for their desserts and their drinks."
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,0,"If you are looking for an alternative to the usual starbucks, you might want to consider this quaint joint along Orchard road."
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,1,The Connoisseur Concerto or commonly known as TCC has both indoor and outdoor seating.
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,2,"Despite being located in the city, the entire place still managed to keep its cozy feel, away from the busy city."
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,3,We opted for this place to meet up with another friend.
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,4,"It's fresh, shabby, country style decor was more than enough for me to soothe me after a walk."
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,5,"Being a big fan of mint chocolates ( I know, only a few are fond of this chocolate class) so I opted for the Mint-Cho Frappe."
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,6,It was already ice-blended but the minty hint added that refreshing and cool feeling.
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,7,I would be coming back to this place just to have a drink and recharge.
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,8,"And maybe have a meal when everything else is quite crowded, but I wouldn't be consistently going back mainly because dining in here is basically a splurge."
diHxZ560zI3S7VqbHkQ_HQ,9,And we don't always splurge right?
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,0,Seriously?
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,1,$1 for a tub of flavored douhua?
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,2,Saw the long line so I decided to dive in and try some.
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,3,"Was pretty excited to try the soft bean curd here but after a couple of spoonfuls, eh, it's wasn't to my liking."
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,4,I don't know how to explain it better except it had a weird combination of really bland douhua and a very sharp sweet taste in the syrup.
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,5,"Like I said, I don't know how else to explain it."
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,6,I prefer a more smoother combination of the both.
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,7,"But hey, for a dollar, why not?"
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,8,"Also, ordered a grass jelly soy milk drink."
iNc4yA1gCLbY_2eWf8MEbw,9,Just average.
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,0,It's a bit of an institution in the Marine Parade scene.
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,1,"Stalls with huge tanks full of lychee, longan, and mixed fruit drinks."
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,2,"It's strange how the fruits always taste so different to what you're used to, and they're even better because of the attapchee (attap seed) that surprises you every now and then."
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,3,"If you're friends with these guys, ask for more and they'll gladly fish some out for you!"
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,4,"There's no shortage of such drink stalls in this food centre, but head along the outside (towards Parkway Parade and McDonalds) and the 2nd last stall is the one you're looking for."
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,5,"Spend $1.20 for a huge cup of mixed fruits and other magic - take it away if you must, but there's something special and nostalgic about the huge fishbowl-like mugs you're served with."
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,6,"These guys have been around since forever, so visit them, or chat with them, or get to know them."
hpNcHq8b2c3tQeQs4UVh2w,7,"They've probably been running this stall since before you were born, and beyond the nasi padang and famous kway teow and amazing vegetarian stall, they win my award for legends of Marine Parade Food Centre."
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,0,This stall is good for two things; herbal tea (duh) and chinese desserts.
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,1,I was having a sore throat and decided to stop here to get a drink while walking around Nex.
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,2,I chose the Chrysanthemum with American ginseng which was just $1.60 a bottle.
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,3,"As soon as I stood at the cashier, a swarm of middle-aged women loomed behind me."
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,4,They were talking excitedly in hokkien about the desserts here.After i got my tea they proceeded to order a whole bunch of things and the desserts were prepared on the spot.
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,5,"I thought this was interesting because in most stalls I've been to, they pre-pack desserts and leave them in a fridge or warmer."
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,6,"I figured if these ladies thought they were good, they must be."
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,7,My throat was too sore for me to be in the mood for any dessert though.
bj0bERXG2G6CweV79ahmyQ,8,Perhaps next time.
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,0,"I don't mean to be offensive to this place, i really don't, but there are some places where you feel like there is no love put into the food."
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,1,It's just made for the sake of making food as a living.
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,2,That's how the food tastes here for me.
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,3,It's just a bit dry without much character or flavor.
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,4,The maggie goreng here was not memorable at all.
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,5,Maybe i tried the wrong dish or got the chef on the wrong day.
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,6,However i left this place feeling like if i had to come back it is probably safest to order a prata.
T-XDX93FLuEh-vV6WmNHHQ,7,The ambience is not too exciting and the staff aren't friendly.
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,0,It's great that places like these still exist - the old school biscuits that used to be sold by the tins are almost a thing of the past.
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,1,"Enter Biscuit King and you'll see tin boxes of what else, biscuits, lined up to the ceiling."
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,2,"You can choose to order the biscuits in portions of 500g, 1kg, by the tin or by the tub (cheapest option)."
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,3,I always get the Sultana - the biscuit with a chewy dried grape interior.
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,4,The store also sells sweets and preserved fruits.
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,5,"If I were a student living in the area, I'd come here everyday after school!"
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,6,It's a candy and biscuits wonderland.
qNSYMzeRcwfc70w80-qPOg,7,Check out their website too - most of their products are online now so you can order your nostalgic biscuits in the comfort of your bed.
6eJxkX4M762cUtGAFB0K4w,0,Stepping into this store is like stepping back into childhood.
6eJxkX4M762cUtGAFB0K4w,1,All the old school candies that I used to love are found again.
6eJxkX4M762cUtGAFB0K4w,2,Tidbits that I thought are already obsolete are found here.
6eJxkX4M762cUtGAFB0K4w,3,Biscuits in old tins that you can buy by weight.
6eJxkX4M762cUtGAFB0K4w,4,"Candies, wafers, Popsicles, etc."
6eJxkX4M762cUtGAFB0K4w,5,check out some of my photos and you will get what I mean.
6eJxkX4M762cUtGAFB0K4w,6,Love nostalgia!
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,0,"I love mangoes, the Mango Paradiso is THE cake I would order again and again."
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,1,"Last year I bought one, took a picture and sent it to a friend."
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,2,"I told him I got it for his birthday; however since he was not around to receive this cake, I would eat it on his behalf, haha!"
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,3,The Mango Paradiso was a cake with layers of mango mousse and creamy jello on top.
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,4,This is probably the most expensive individual cake in the case but worth every penny.
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,5,The rest of the cakes are decent but this Mango Paradiso just stands out among the rest.
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,6,"As for bread, the very popular floss bun is my favorite."
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,7,I have once saw an imposter at Sweet Hut (outside Atlanta); the one at Sweet Hut tasted funky and looked nothing like the one at Breadtalk.
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,8,"I also like the chocolate swirl bread, reminded me of those served at the Executive Lounge at Conrad Tokyo."
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,9,Staffs are nice and friendly.
ZARIldsLLG-i1EdBuBcUaQ,10,Breadtalk is my go to bakery in Singapore.
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,0,Gayatri in Telok Ayer St is open 7 days a week and its great as it can be hard to find a place open everyday in the CBD.
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,1,The food here is very authentic and very good.
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,2,"Be prepared to shell out a bit more than a hawker stall though, but it is worth it."
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,3,"Try the vegetarian briyani, served with vegetarian side dishes."
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,4,"Portions are huge here and hard to finish, so I think its worth the price."
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,5,"In the mornings, they have traditional Indian breakfast foods like dosai, prata and idli."
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,6,T he staff is very nice and know you by face.
KGAZQ3G-7OYLlJYfvfmJvA,7,A must try in Singapore.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,0,"Edit update 9 March 2013: You know, we've gone back here many many times since my first visit and 2 star review and there's more to Gayatri than my first impressions."
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,1,It's my wife's favorite spot now so we go there pretty frequently.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,2,Their masala dosa is so delicious and a bargain at $3.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,3,Egg Prata is fantastic.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,4,Their veggie dishes are also good.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,5,"Their meat dishes are over-priced but if you don't mind eating vegetarian, the prices are reasonable."
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,6,I had a fantastic take-away vegetarian lunch for only $5.50 (see picture).
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,7,Old Review: Nothing memorable.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,8,I've yet to find out of this world Indian food in Singapore which is surprising.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,9,Someone help!
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,10,"Gayatri looks very nice on the outside, it's clean and well kept on a corner across from Amoy Food Centre."
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,11,Everything looks delicious and the prices are a tad higher than what you'd normally get at a hawker stall.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,12,The food was average.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,13,I don't remember it being anything special.
iZ1usxaSKd2MbmgKzMeUKA,14,My search for good Indian food in Singapore continues...
WjLUbQFZOV2DtMjSLoy30w,0,"On a whirlwind trip to Singapore for work, I hadn't had a chance to eat any dumplings, so I wanted to get my fix as I was leaving."
WjLUbQFZOV2DtMjSLoy30w,1,I know airport food is usually terrible but at the newer section at Changi I had previously had some great dumplings at a restaurant recommended by a local.
WjLUbQFZOV2DtMjSLoy30w,2,I was at the older budget terminal this time.
WjLUbQFZOV2DtMjSLoy30w,3,"I headed to Hong Kong Sheng Kee Dessert, and I ordered some Shumai (prok dumplings) and some Liu Sha Bao (salted egg custard buns)."
WjLUbQFZOV2DtMjSLoy30w,4,The Shumai looked like it had been made and cooked 3 months ago so I didn't even touch it.
WjLUbQFZOV2DtMjSLoy30w,5,"I gave the salted egg custard buns a go, but they tasted pretty stale too."
WjLUbQFZOV2DtMjSLoy30w,6,I would not recommend this eatery.
5QAl8T5sTwM6TYo5tj1Isw,0,This is our go to restaurant for Roti Prata whilst in Singapore and we'll quite often dine at Prata Wala on a couple of occasions in our short time there.
5QAl8T5sTwM6TYo5tj1Isw,1,I'm a big fan of the Roti Prata and Garlic Naan with Butter Chicken to dip in.
5QAl8T5sTwM6TYo5tj1Isw,2,Of all the times we've been I've only had one prata come out that wasn't that perfect crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside that I so love.
5QAl8T5sTwM6TYo5tj1Isw,3,The service won't set the world on fire and it's not as cheap as some of the hawker stalls you might find but the quality in the food is definitely there and I'd say you get good bang for your buck.
5QAl8T5sTwM6TYo5tj1Isw,4,I don't usually enjoy the Murtabak as much as the roti or naan as it can be soggy and too rich for me but the roti and naan is as good as I've had anywhere and I'd highly recommend Prata Wala.
pzA94hmrW_FLMW7gHV4QjA,0,"A great place to take the family for dinner - its relaxed, the food comes out fast, and everything is tasty (as its name suggests :P)."
pzA94hmrW_FLMW7gHV4QjA,1,"Their dishes are all pretty good - but their hor fan, shrimp paste chicken and fish head curry are a must have for every trip that I make there."
pzA94hmrW_FLMW7gHV4QjA,2,"Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed - its really your local zhi char place in a restaurant setting, but without the service charge and gst!"
pzA94hmrW_FLMW7gHV4QjA,3,"Plus points for that :) Â Also, their sambal chilli is really really yummy too - so make sure you ask for some."
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,0,I've always been a fan of Different Taste and my favourite dish of all has got to be their penang kway teow.
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,1,its got the right amount of chilli and the kway teow noodles are fried perfectly.
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,2,The fish head curry is also another killer dish.
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,3,the fish meat is tender and its soaked up all that beautiful curry flavour.
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,4,Pair that with a plate of white rice and you're all set.
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,5,The ha chiong kai is also very good.
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,6,as is the foo yong omelette.
902sLu187OFZfn2F1ujLUQ,7,One fo the best zi char restaurants around.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,0,"Having done well in their first outlet at Ang Mo Kio, Soi 19 Wanton Mee in Singapore has decided to open another outlet at a coffee shop just a few minutes walk from Jurong MRT."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,1,I haven't tried this before at all and decided give it a go today.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,2,I literally just finished eating and decided to give my review on this immediately - I got here about 1:15pm on a Friday afternoon and joined the queue.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,3,Took me about 10mins to receive my order?
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,4,They're pretty fast as they take your order whilst you're still in the queue.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,5,I ordered the jumbo portion since I don't live anywhere near both their outlets and felt I probably wouldn't come here often anyways.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,6,Now on to the food!
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,7,"The portion of $6 (jumbo) is pretty huge, even for a big guy like me."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,8,Don't really need to order this size unless you're like super starving as it seems pretty generous.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,9,All you need to do is help yourself to the chilli as they serve the bowl to you.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,10,"As Thai wanton mee goes, the choices of chilli are the chilli flakes or the green chillies like your usual local wanton mee."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,11,Choose either or both.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,12,"The bowl of noodles comes with a small bowl of wanton soup, again the usual standard."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,13,Here's the part about the noodles.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,14,"It is QQ as everyone says, quite generous with the ingredients which includes fried dumplings, charsiew and pork lard."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,15,All quite generous.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,16,The noodles I felt was a little dry and slightly clumped together.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,17,I had to pour some soup into the mix to loosen up the noodles slightly.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,18,"Taste wise, I felt if they had removed the name ""soi19"", I wouldn't have know its Thai in any way."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,19,The Charsiew was pretty average and so were the wantons.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,20,They also add Chinese sausage slices inside.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,21,Pretty interesting.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,22,"They aren't BAD by any means, just that I guess it was probably very overhyped."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,23,Do bear in mind that my only reference from Thai wanton mee is the one at Alibabar at katong called Baan by Rochor Thai.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,24,"THAT wanton mee in particular tasted ""Thai"" to me."
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,25,This one was just a VERY handsome portion of noodles with quite a variety of ingredients unlike the usual.
GXbQSo3H6wy3UukD7LW5MA,26,3.5 Stars
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,0,Dean's cafe was featured on a channel u food programme on interesting zhi char stall.
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,1,"The 3 dishes that were featured on tv were the crispy duck, the cai por (preserved radish) hor fun and its been hoon with crab."
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,2,The missus and I decided to give it a try after watching the TV feature.
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,3,Took us a while to find the place.
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,4,The 3 dishes featured were now extra popular and there were signs everywhere featuring the 3 dishes.
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,5,"Dean's Cafe is essentially a chinese restaurant, in a coffeeshop setting and prices."
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,6,The cai por hor fun is super nice and value for money.
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,7,The hor fun is cooked like and has the texture of carrot cake.
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,8,The cai por hor fun is supposedly now a very rarely-found dish in Singapore.
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,9,"The crispy duck was a little disappointing mostly because we bought it to go, so by the time we reached home, the duck may not taste as good."
iU9Hp6I2_E4Ls3pFMHW8rg,10,Would recommend eating it on the spot.
py_2cvtgfnZyPznou9RonQ,0,"A feel of al fresco eating ambience, especially after sun set."
py_2cvtgfnZyPznou9RonQ,1,Tables n chairs are quite tightly spaced though.
py_2cvtgfnZyPznou9RonQ,2,Their crispy duck n cai por hor fun are unique and are their signature dishes to try.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,0,This is my first time coming here.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,1,For my family moat have been here many times.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,2,"Firstly if you have a big group in type party, be sure to get there early or you'll be hard pressed to find a big table."
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,3,Their signature dosh is the herbal crispy duck.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,4,We had a half portion for all 13 to share.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,5,It war good.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,6,The duck was tender.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,7,The flavor wasn't over powering.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,8,Other dishes were just the usual good food standard.
zbOOZ9uVAN4TUulB7PXzUg,9,"Because my time here is limited, i will have to give this place a miss even though i think it is really quite good"
aVAalb5FGa7BoBu5qxmIIA,0,"When it comes to prata, I always believe the best ones are from stalls in old hawker centres."
aVAalb5FGa7BoBu5qxmIIA,1,"Of course, there's also the ones along Jalan Kayu."
aVAalb5FGa7BoBu5qxmIIA,2,But if you find yourself in Jurong Point for whatever reason and have a craving for roti prata - avoid prata wala at all costs.
aVAalb5FGa7BoBu5qxmIIA,3,More appalling is their claim to be the best Singapore Indian restaurant.
aVAalb5FGa7BoBu5qxmIIA,4,I dunno about their other outlets but this one at Jurong Point is definitely disappointing.
aVAalb5FGa7BoBu5qxmIIA,5,"Too expensive for prata and briyani, food is too oily and service is poor."
aVAalb5FGa7BoBu5qxmIIA,6,The cleanliness of the place also leaves much to be desired.
9Qd-EMW2LsNj8Q_hVDEQtA,0,This is a food truck parked in the newly renovated food area of NTU.
9Qd-EMW2LsNj8Q_hVDEQtA,1,Let's keep this short.
9Qd-EMW2LsNj8Q_hVDEQtA,2,The service is poor and disorganized.
9Qd-EMW2LsNj8Q_hVDEQtA,3,"The food takes 20 minutes to come out, which defies the laws of food trucks as well as the local hawker climate."
9Qd-EMW2LsNj8Q_hVDEQtA,4,"On top of that, the food isn't made to order or freshly prepared, so we were all wondering what was going on back there."
9Qd-EMW2LsNj8Q_hVDEQtA,5,"The quality of the food is similar to a poor airline meal: dehydrated eggs with a soupy consistency, soggy waffles, uncooked bacon..."
9Qd-EMW2LsNj8Q_hVDEQtA,6,Skip this place for sure.
p2EAN6vMijN-VC4FMO-mlA,0,This little bakery in Old Airport Road Food Centre serves up awesome muffins; not your usual type of hawker food but these m uffins are absolutely yummylicious.
p2EAN6vMijN-VC4FMO-mlA,1,"The muffins are divine, soft buttery and great when warm."
p2EAN6vMijN-VC4FMO-mlA,2,"They've got a whole range of flavours, I favour the chocolate ones (chocolate chip, double chocolate chip, chocolate rice...) but the others are quite good too (raisin, cornflake...)."
p2EAN6vMijN-VC4FMO-mlA,3,"they also serve up pretty good and large egg tarts, all freshly baked on site in the morning, so if you're in the mood for snacks, this is where you should head."
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,0,Walked past this place every now and then as it is located at the J-walk area on the 2nd level linking Westgate and JEM.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,1,Decided to try this out since it had quite a bit of queue when I went there.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,2,"Ordered plain prata, curry bun and dry laksa for myself as they are the recommended list of foods according to the menu."
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,3,The environment seemed to go back in time - Chinese heritage and the servers were wearing the olden clothing which looked a little like pajamas in my friend's eyes.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,4,Food came out pretty fast.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,5,The plates really bring me back to the days when I was younger.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,6,The food presentation was very well done especially for the dry laksa as it looked very appetizing.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,7,Tried the curry bun first.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,8,It was good but the curry wasn't a lot to have that wow-ing factor.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,9,Then the prata.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,10,It was crispy at the bottom part of it.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,11,The curry was also very flavorful.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,12,"For the price, it was worth it."
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,13,It is one of the best prata in town.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,14,The dry laksa had three prawns on it and I had to place it on the side as I am not really into steamed prawns and I am allergic to shellfish.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,15,"I tried the dry laksa, it was not as good as the food presentation."
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,16,But the portion was big (or maybe I ordered too much).
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,17,Might try other food besides the famous dry laksa next time round.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,18,"At the counter, there are papers which can become a cup and a container of snacks that you could enjoy after you pay your bill."
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,19,I love that tidbit that I was eyeing on it when other people serving themselves.
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,20,"Overall, this place is on the pricier end and I might only come here to eat the prata."
K0PEiLvnNjQj2HJYi6EbeA,21,Will probably try other foods when I am back here.
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,0,"The place was empty when we walked in, but it was packed when we left."
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,1,The food dishes all tasted different.
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,2,A great sign of a good restaurant.
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,3,Mostly chicken and vegetarian dishes.
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,4,"The nann was hot, fresh, and had a unique flavor - really good too!"
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,5,We had the buffet with folks from work.
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,6,"Very comfortable and a good price $15 which included a drink, tax, and service changes."
Dk5hh19Uqn-GTFvDAKnKXA,7,I will be coming back.
rWxAuWuAKIlNAfcGLjTY6w,0,Pros: Vegetarian food Quick service Cons: Pedestrian flavors Only one option for set thaali When you have North Indian food on the menu why not have a North Indian thaali option?
rWxAuWuAKIlNAfcGLjTY6w,1,There are 22 Indian joints in the area and this one doesn't cut the mustard.
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,0,The revolutionary pudding-like bean curd from Lao Ban has definitely sparked many tau huay makers to come up with similar cold desserts.
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,1,One of the most successful competitors in my opinion would be Yummy Soy!
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,2,"Compared to Lao Ban that has only two flavors, namely original and almond, Yummy Soy has creatively come up with many savory flavors, such as caramel, matcha, vanilla, almond, macadamia nut, hazelnut, strawberry, blueberry, toffee nut... and the list just seems to go on."
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,3,"It may be hard to imagine some of these flavors put together with bean curd, but Yummy Soy has made it possible!"
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,4,"There is quite a good balance between the savory flavor and the soy taste, which makes you want to try out the other flavors."
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,5,The cold silky smooth bean curd is a truly a perfect cold dessert to go along on a hot afternoon.
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,6,"If you are in a hurry, they also have flavored bean curd in a cup!"
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,7,That is something that is not ordinarily offered at other tau huay stores too.
_QfKTGNrFEpjitsZ6EKWaA,8,"So if you fancy something that will excite your taste buds, Yummy Soy is not to be missed!"
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,0,This is a small outlet so the selection of bread is not as wide as other places.
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,1,"You will still get the favorites - chocola cheese, raisin and walnut, cranberry walnut, pizza onion toast..... Another difference I noticed is there are no tasting basket for every type of bun/bread."
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,2,Only a few will get the sampling basket and there is a staff member holding a tray with a few samples for customers to try.
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,3,The bread is still very good.
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,4,"Chewy, light and packed with flavor."
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,5,"Compared to other bakeries, the prices are a bit on the high side with most bread starting from $3+."
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,6,"But the bread is much bigger and when you get a bit of cheese, chocolate, nuts in every bite, I think it is quite alright."
vOdpnP7FaJLR0izypMW8wg,7,I am just glad there is finally an outlet in the Orchard Road shopping belt area.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,0,"Speaking of deli-counters, everyone knows which is their heart's desire."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,1,"I seldom frequent a pÃ¢tisserie, at most a boulangerie."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,2,"Most commonly seen these days, are either tagging a European heritage or a Japanese label, anchoring at some malls - majestic or humble."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,3,"Another group will hole up at some remote or bustling hotels, sometimes an extension of the main restaurant while others are stand alone without parentage."

WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,5,"Confession I must, I have never been to Regent Singapore, at best, driving past."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,6,"So, when others mentioned about the takeaway deli over at the hotel, I couldn't visualize where and how to get to it."

WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,8,"Once you enter the hotel main entrance, head towards the lobby at 12o'clock, until you reach the far end which is walled in glass panels."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,9,Dolcetto is just on your 9 o'clock - sit tightly in a corner.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,10,"With a few round tables and long sofa in the lobby, one simply shop in the deli - scan the display, place your order and make the payment before pulling your tray of items off the cashier to any available seats."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,11,"Barely any soul, except a few in-house guests waiting to check into their rooms."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,12,"The time was 2.30pm, a Friday."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,13,"I found myself a decent table to interrogate my subject, though I wish it has been a date."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,14,"Spoilt with choices, I cherry-picked the elegant looking mini tart - Forest Berries."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,15,This beautiful treat enchants you with its sweetness that was meant for the faint heart - mild and calming.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,16,A very thin layer of delicate custard was seen cushioned between a bushel of huge plumpish strawberries & its cousins and a less buttery crisp shell.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,17,"Though the silkiness of the custard won me over, I still prefer they rubbed in more butter for a richer tart shell."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,18,Perhaps a few more scoops of fillings to satiate my greed.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,19,"Prior to that, I think it has been overpriced for its content, $9 a piece."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,20,Then comes the savory.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,21,"Less attractive, something that you wouldn't care for a second look probably."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,22,Many may pace up and down the display and thought it was just another sweet mini French burger treats - Macaroon.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,23,"Stay close and read those tags which spelled their names in flowing strokes, you will realized that they ain't all sweet treats."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,24,"I asked the lady for a Smoked Salmon classic, and the dusky cookie make it to the plate, alongside the jeweled tart."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,25,A complete contrast between a beauty and the beast from afar!
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,26,"Instantly, prejudice sets in when confronted with visual appeal but it turned out to be an unfair judgement."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,27,"If you think a sweet shell is at odds with salmon fillings, reconsider that please."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,28,"I am surprised by the unconventional making, the mixture of mellow sweet crisp cookie embodied a dollop of silky creme wrapping some melting salmon with a rich savory & smokey finish."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,29,"No overbearing fishiness was seen marring the light, gently crackling almond meringue shell, heavenly."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,30,"For once, I tasted a refined French treat which didn't put me off with its immeasurable sweetness but one that was light and playful."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,31,A $2.25 per piece is so reasonable to ask for another.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,32,"To wash down my tea treats, I had a dose of cappuccino that smoothed my throat but less lingering."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,33,I am glad that this cup was worth $5.60 instead of $15 that was charged by mistake for 3 doses at first.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,34,"Please do check your bill if it sounds unbelievable, I was happy that I did."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,35,"Do not be misled by my choices, there are plenty of artisanal breads, sweet muffins, doughnuts, mouth-watering sandwiches and even tiny sweets like cookies and chocolates on the shelves."
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,36,But be forewarned that the price is steep.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,37,"If there's anything that I would bond with, the freestyle squid ink smoked salmon shall be it!"
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,38,This classic arrives without confining rules - highly praised.
WGABAOgdQukb_DGKJf6PIw,39,I will be most happy to ask for a second piece anytime soon whenever Dolcetto is call upon.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,0,"If you happen to spot a white color mousse cake studded with dried fruits called ""Cassata Siciliana"" at any local patisserie, don't think much, just get it."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,1,It is such a traditional and peripheral cake that few pastry chefs in Singapore would ever think of making one.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,2,"The rarity drove me to get a slice at Dolcetto by Basilico, despite being already full to the brims."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,3,"This Italian pastry shop used to be my to-go place for takeaway pastries when it was still under the name of ""Something to Go""."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,4,"The interior and menu have been revamped, but the signatures like Strawberry Torte, Praline Torte and Espresso Tiramisu still stay."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,5,"In the spirit of all things Italian, all the pastries here that involved chocolate are made with Tuscany's organic chocolate brand Amedei, which is perhaps also one of the world's most expensive chocolate."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,6,Take for example the Amedei Chocolate Pumpkin Tart ($9) that took a sinful detour from the usual pumpkin pie.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,7,"The mastery of the cacao tones is virtually undisputed, so does the crisp tart shell which not overworked and perfect in volume with the filling."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,8,Pumpkin is one of my favorite ingredients but the taste seemed to have wandered off to elsewhere and did not meld together with the chocolate The Praline Torte ($9) is hard not to love with the appealing crunchy base.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,9,"But I was craving for something less milky, something more intense and I figured that the other option of Amedei Dark Chocolate Cake would have satisfied my lust for chocolate."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,10,"Bright juicy and sweet, the soft chunks of pineapple rested amidst the delectable vanilla baked custard in this humble Italian Crostata ($9)."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,11,"But instead of being served the traditional family way in big, rustic free-form version, it has been elevated to the fine ranks of French gateaux with mild ""Violette perfumes"" and a touch of gold on top of the dainty raspberries."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,12,The Espresso Marsala Cake ($9) was our unanimous pick.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,13,"It might seem like a messy pile of various textures (crunch, custard, sponge, ganache, gelee) but I loved the sweetness from the Marsala wine even though the espresso kick wasn't assertive as I had imagined."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,14,And of course the delightful sound of the crushed chocolate pearls is music to the ears.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,15,One can't miss the conspicuous fresh-baked pane (breads) that are stacked along the wall.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,16,"We've finally got a taste of the famous squid ink panini with fresh king crab and prawns ($13), a hearty dense and chewy sandwich that seemed a little deprived of tantalizing juices from the filling."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,17,The Roasted Chicken & Cheese Foccacia might not be brimming with luxury ingredients but the flavors were simple and comforting.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,18,Many may raise eyebrows at the sight of Squid Ink Salmon Macaron but it is quite a success.
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,19,"In fact, a good step to convert those who usually steer away from these sugary meringue bites."
k5F7zTrZpEDs3pcCNn1rvg,20,"The chewy shells appeared rather flattened but the flavors were spot on, especially the Vanilla Prosecco and Cassis."
-4plbMtzdXgVqC3I85vNOg,0,The shopfront is something out of a dream or a movie.
-4plbMtzdXgVqC3I85vNOg,1,"It is a bakery and sweet lover's paradise - even outside the entrance you can spot the mounds of pastries and breads baked to perfection, so much so that they look fake!"
-4plbMtzdXgVqC3I85vNOg,2,I was reeled in straight away and had a croisssant.
-4plbMtzdXgVqC3I85vNOg,3,It was everything I had hoped it to be.
-4plbMtzdXgVqC3I85vNOg,4,"Flaky and crispy on the outside, and soft, fluffy and airy on the inside."
-4plbMtzdXgVqC3I85vNOg,5,The pastries and cakes looked picture perfect and I wish I had bought one!
c2ZJowXxC6w1wAYX36bazw,0,"It is served the same style as the famed soup minced pork noodles at fengshan block 85 market, except that this is served with wanton rather than pork balls."
c2ZJowXxC6w1wAYX36bazw,1,"Garlicky soup, al dente noodles."
c2ZJowXxC6w1wAYX36bazw,2,I found the noodles to be thicker.
c2ZJowXxC6w1wAYX36bazw,3,"Nonetheless, It is a good bowl of noodles, But it doesn't hit the spot like the one at Block 85."
c2ZJowXxC6w1wAYX36bazw,4,"However, since block 85 only opens in the evening, if you have a carving for soup minced pork noodles in the dot, this may be the only place."
c2ZJowXxC6w1wAYX36bazw,5,Expect a wait of at least 20min on weekends.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,0,Jiak Pa Lang?
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,1,based on the chinese characters in their signage it would mean to eat one's fill.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,2,but there is also a similar sounding phrase which means a collection of random items?
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,3,i have only tried their lunch menu which is based on the concept of salad and rice bowls.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,4,a localized version of the western concept or a westernized version of our local chap chye peng?
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,5,"it marries the best of both worlds, in my opinion."
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,6,high quality gourmet ingredients not commonly found in the local economical rice stalls and delightfully local flavours injected into a normally boring ang mo salad or sometimes overly healthy rice bowl.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,7,"here, they strike a good balance and is neither too cheap nor too expensive."
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,8,"i would get the value set additions, especially their daily soup, homemade goodness with every sip."
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,9,it can get crowded and noisy during lunch peak hours.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,10,but they try their best to speed up the ordering process with mobile tablets and staff moving down the line of hungry diners to expedite order taking.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,11,plentiful aircon seating within and outdoors as well.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,12,can be very boisterous and cafeteria like indoors.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,13,clean bathrooms and charging points aplenty but do select seats strategically as needed.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,14,i have not tried their dinner menu yet as they are only open on weekdays.
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,15,"but from what i read, their innovative creations, or remakes, of local zi char dishes will be what you can expect."
PHKEHlmO8J8r3Nbbw4gd7g,16,if their lunch is a good gauge then i will be in for a palate tantalizing dinner treat when i do find time for a weekday evening meal here!
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,0,"""a hungry man is an angry man""."
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,1,i'm writing this review while waiting for more than 20 minutes for the main course we ordered.
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,2,me and my friend decided to try this restaurant because the food looks delish.
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,3,"we came in, decided to order calamari for appetizer (not bad), pesto chicken salad (tastes ok), grilled dory fish and grilled chicken."
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,4,"before we decided to order the items above, we WANTED pizza."
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,5,"After taking our order, we waited with so much gusto only to find out (first 20 mins of waiting) that they ran out of pizza sauce!"
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,6,Seriously?
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,7,"Now, into the main course, they have lots lots to choose from (which at times is a disadvantage)."
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,8,You can also choose between having 1 or 2 side dish.
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,9,"But on this particular day, only 3 amongst 10 or 11 choices are available!"
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,10,WOW!
6aRUGxRZ4FySfV8kNydn3w,11,"Now that I'm full, Id probably give this restaurant a 2nd chance."
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,0,WAITING TIME: VERY LONG :/ The salads & drinks came fast and then the first meal (aglio olio) came in about 7-10 min & but then the second meal (breaded chicken + fries) came after about 15-18 min & the longest was the third meal that only came after about 30 min after prompting the service staff.
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,1,"After our meal, we asked for the free scoop of icecream that came with the lunch set and after waiting for 10-15 min we called again with the staff and yet another 10-15 min waiting & it was long after the peak hour after so much waiting (came in at around 145pm & left at about 315pm) then after raising our hand for the 3rd time for about 5 min then a walking by staff saw us from another table and finally got our 3 scoops of icecream."
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,2,HYGIENE: OKAY The tables were wet with some yellowish brown stains when i used a piece of tissue to clean & some unknown liquid was dripping from the bottom of the table & there was a weird odour but the utensils looked clean.
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,3,PRICE: NOT CHEAP 3 set lunches cost us near $50 FOOD: NOT BAD The food were not bad even though the waiting time was really long.
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,4,The spaghetti had flavour and the chicken was cooked well & the icecream was delicious.
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,5,Also the proportions were good and filling not stingy.
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,6,"OVERALL EXPERIENCE: If the hygiene was cleaner / the food had a slightly shorter waiting time, i would have given it a four star without doubt as the food is good."
lXpctt4ih-r-U1uG-swu-g,7,I will return and hopefully it will be a better experience!
0lf3bOVHKXEPg2izNhax-A,0,"Tugged away in one corner of Bukit Timah Plaza, I was first attracted by the affordable prices and wide selection of bread."
0lf3bOVHKXEPg2izNhax-A,1,I got the green tea loaf which was a steal at 6 slices for only $2!
0lf3bOVHKXEPg2izNhax-A,2,It comes in two sizes.
0lf3bOVHKXEPg2izNhax-A,3,The green color was eye catching and the fragrance was great.
0lf3bOVHKXEPg2izNhax-A,4,The red beans also complemented the taste and I found the bread good enough to eat on its own.
0lf3bOVHKXEPg2izNhax-A,5,"The next time I return, I'm going for the bigger size!"
CJ8m5o6qSgy8MkgYzixRiw,0,"As one of the only few bakeries in the area, Swee Heng is usually my go-to shop for those fancy bread made popular by BreadTalk."
CJ8m5o6qSgy8MkgYzixRiw,1,"You know which ones I'm talking about: the floss buns, otah-otah buns, fish fillet buns, and all sorts of buns imaginable."
CJ8m5o6qSgy8MkgYzixRiw,2,"Swee Heng frequently has promotions like 4 pieces of buns for S$3, but these are inconsistent and sometimes the price changes, so I don't keep track of them."
CJ8m5o6qSgy8MkgYzixRiw,3,"But even on their own, the buns are affordable, usually costing less than S$2 per piece."
CJ8m5o6qSgy8MkgYzixRiw,4,"Besides these breads, they also sell other stuff like birthday cakes, pastries, and biscuits."
CJ8m5o6qSgy8MkgYzixRiw,5,"If you drop by later on at night, they might have some promotion going on where you can buy more bread at a cheaper price to finish selling everything before they close."
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,0,Designer Bakes is a really good place for specially designed Cupcakes and pies.
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,1,It's more about the design then the taste though.
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,2,The cupcakes are a bit dry and the icing is pretty hard and not delicious.
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,3,If you look at the pictures you can get a good impression of the design they do.
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,4,"My favorite are the angry birds cupcakes, they look so funny, cute and happy."
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,5,Perfect to bring as a gift.
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,6,"If you have special request, they can also entertain them and you can tell them your requirements."
fcLrSZ1a10araxzmgD60Iw,7,"The lady behind designer bake is very skillful, but if you have special request it can get pretty pricey."
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,0,Dropped by this small cafe for tea to catch up with an old buddy.
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,1,"Neither of us have ever tried their pastries out before, so we asked the staff for recommendations."
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,2,She immediately pointed out the premium flavours.
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,3,"Okay, we should have thought of that - higher price suggests better quality?"
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,4,"Anyway, she left us to decide for ourselves."
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,5,"My friend and I shared the strawberry, blueberry and peach flavours."
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,6,We got the mini ones as they looked big enough.
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,7,"The strudels were very nice, light, flaky and crispy."
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,8,I love the fact that the strudels weren't too sweet either.
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,9,"The cafe was empty when we arrived, so we got to enjoy our strudels in peace."
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,10,The staff was in no hurry to chase us out either.
E5tJr9y0zjblR0uHVebSLg,11,"They don't charge GST and service charge, so okaylah, I can't Â complain much."
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,0,My Singapore trip won't be complete with having pepper crab and chili crab!
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,1,We avoid the long queue and crowded popular spots and came to this Jumbo at NSRCC.
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,2,This place is far from town but it's very chilled!
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,3,"Lots of greens, big koi fish pond, gold course..."
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,4,Overall very relaxed atmosphere!
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,5,The seafood dishes were up to expectation!
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,6,My favorite is still the black pepper crab!
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,7,Sooo tasty!!
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,8,"With NSRCC membership, you will get 10% off."
Eej-TpxWAJ2dFjNvNnDpGQ,9,Will definitely come back next time I'm in town.
WqdBjJTXybbeWpR-zmEiZg,0,Can't resist my favourite black pepper crab so went straight from the airport to meet hubby there for dinner after being away for 3 weeks... Can you imagine the ride there...
WqdBjJTXybbeWpR-zmEiZg,1,It wasn't crowded at slightly past 8 but hubby did make the reservation so I won't be disappointed Of course I ordered my fav and hubby ordered his too!
WqdBjJTXybbeWpR-zmEiZg,2,His fav is the steamed crabs... sweetness is somewhat retained and the steamed egg white at the bottom is really smooth.
WqdBjJTXybbeWpR-zmEiZg,3,But I'm still loving mine!!!!
WqdBjJTXybbeWpR-zmEiZg,4,Pure divine with wine!
WqdBjJTXybbeWpR-zmEiZg,5,!
GVtswfgnyNrYodcEsIUIEQ,0,I had always been curious what all the hype is about this place so decided to come for lunch and oh boy boy boy...got there at 12:05pm and got my food at 12:45pm.
GVtswfgnyNrYodcEsIUIEQ,1,That's 15 minutes before my call so had to eat what I can and left in a hurry.
GVtswfgnyNrYodcEsIUIEQ,2,What was the reason why it took forever to bring my food when I was the only customer there?
GVtswfgnyNrYodcEsIUIEQ,3,"They apparently ""broke"" my fish."
GVtswfgnyNrYodcEsIUIEQ,4,I don't even know what that means.
GVtswfgnyNrYodcEsIUIEQ,5,"At least a server had a decency to come, apologize and explain that it will just take few more minutes and explained(?)."
GVtswfgnyNrYodcEsIUIEQ,6,"Anyway, the cod was but fishy and so was his excuse (no pun intended)"
C2HUxj4L-9E7CIeb4f8BoA,0,"Floating on a former barge, this floating restaurant is offers fresh fresh seafoods as well as common Zhi char style dishes."
C2HUxj4L-9E7CIeb4f8BoA,1,"I had e seafood mee goreng, not the best tasting but fresh seafood none the less."
C2HUxj4L-9E7CIeb4f8BoA,2,"Kayak there, or boat there, a unique dining experience, ESP in city dwelling Singapore."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,0,"When I came here for a dinner, it was completely empty."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,1,"There was no one around, which doesn't bode well for a restaurant, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,2,"My friend and I ordered a grilled platter to share, and some sides that were on promotion."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,3,"The sides arrived, and they were disappointing."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,4,"Oily and fried to a crisp, I could not taste the white bait."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,5,I could only taste old oil.
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,6,Awful.
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,7,"The platter took longer, understandably, and thankfully, it was slightly better."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,8,"However, the mussels weren't fresh."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,9,"Neither were the prawns, but they tasted alright at least."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,10,"I enjoyed the squid as it was well cooked, but not overly so that it was rubbery."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,11,"The fish fillet was smothered in butter, but also tasted good."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,12,I didn't mind the rice they served at the bottom of the pan.
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,13,"It went pretty alright with the seafood, but it was fairly uninspiring."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,14,"Ambience wise, this place was fairly boring."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,15,It felt like a slightly more upmarket Long John's Silver actually.
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,16,"It had the look and feel of a fast food joint, with tacky nautical decorations."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,17,Definitely not suitable for a date.
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,18,It's probably better for larger group gatherings where you can share the items.
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,19,"Service was efficient, but again, no smiles."
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,20,I've noticed this problem all over Singapore.
r7EGL4k27-O4fsmGZHxH9Q,21,It really doesn't hurt to smile a little.
DAvaVHGE2-hGKmUyAF_DiQ,0,"Nice personal afternoon coffee, if you prefer a bit sour coffee bean, it is a nice choice."
DAvaVHGE2-hGKmUyAF_DiQ,1,"Next to the national library, at the cross of North Bridge Rd and Seah St."
DAvaVHGE2-hGKmUyAF_DiQ,2,"There are many outside seats, and face the white building which is part of Raffles City."
wfio0WZAVEoJcaa_qGP_iA,0,I have this gut feeling that the only reason I came here was because it was a random place that I picked to have a coffee at so that I could do a write up of another place on Yelp.
wfio0WZAVEoJcaa_qGP_iA,1,"Well, the fact that it has been left until I have posted all of the cool places that I wanted to post sooner rather than later suggests that this place wasn't all that fantastic."
wfio0WZAVEoJcaa_qGP_iA,2,"To be honest, no, it wasn't all that fantastic."
wfio0WZAVEoJcaa_qGP_iA,3,"In fact it was quite forgetable, which is probably why I left it that long."
wfio0WZAVEoJcaa_qGP_iA,4,"Mind you, the fact that I did leave it probably indicates that the coffee wasn't all that bad, but it wasn't fantastic either."
IGjy6Js4u3zhFz0i8ziYGg,0,"Mad Jack is where you can find Halal western food, with a local twist!"
IGjy6Js4u3zhFz0i8ziYGg,1,"The food served here is quite decent, and has a great variety for you to choose from: appetizers, finger food, salads, pastas, burgers and even desserts."
IGjy6Js4u3zhFz0i8ziYGg,2,"What's more, the prices are pretty reasonable and friendly to the pocket."
IGjy6Js4u3zhFz0i8ziYGg,3,"If you love chocolate and like it sweet, you'd love their brownie with ice cream and M.A.D & Rich cake."
IGjy6Js4u3zhFz0i8ziYGg,4,"Personally, it tastes a little too sweet."
IGjy6Js4u3zhFz0i8ziYGg,5,"If you're too lazy to get out of the house, you can also call for delivery."
IGjy6Js4u3zhFz0i8ziYGg,6,"Overall, satisfactory food that is value for money."
hQqsOLI_Im2kWZ-kfrN5rA,0,"This bakery is famous for their selection of soft breads, in particular their raisin and cream cheese bread."
hQqsOLI_Im2kWZ-kfrN5rA,1,"I'm not really a fan of soft breads and i'm not that lyrical as my colleagues about the raising cream cheese bread, judge it for yourself though!"
hQqsOLI_Im2kWZ-kfrN5rA,2,I do like the normal freshly baked bread.
hQqsOLI_Im2kWZ-kfrN5rA,3,You can tell by the small display and the huge machinery that they have a very high turnover on freshly baked breaks and buns.
hQqsOLI_Im2kWZ-kfrN5rA,4,That keeps the quality high and the bread fresh and warm.
hQqsOLI_Im2kWZ-kfrN5rA,5,The cakes are not their specialty and therefore ok-only.
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,0,"Okay, it's obvious from the length of the queue that the general public doesn't Â think that the son fries as good a Chye Tao Kueh as the father did."
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,1,"Senior had been frying for years, many, many years."
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,2,"I mean as late as 2012, he was still charging $1.50 per plate, that's like 1980's pricing, man!"
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,3,"To me though, there's little to choose between junior's and senior's carrot cake."
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,4,"Yes, junior doesn't use so much of the black sweet sauce, and perhaps isn't so thorough to make sure that the flavour infuses every single morsel on the plate, but he's more daring in allowing the carrot cake to sit a little longer in the pan and so you do get more charred bits that add another dimension to the dish itself."
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,5,"To the uninitiated, the fried carrot cake we're referring here to is the white carrot or radish version."
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,6,"It comes in 2 forms, the white version, which is without the darkened sweet sauce (same stuff used in Char Kway Teow) and is usually eaten with a generous dash of pepper, and the black version (ask for 'orh eh'), which is the version I always order."
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,7,"So whilst I rate it a 4, because it's not quite the same as the old man's, it's still perhaps the only Chye Tao Kueh I will drive for."
7RzzNyJ3ch_MpZ_KyKKT9w,8,"And on the bright side, you no longer have to queue half an hour for this breakfast Favourite."
pDOpX4ScixFjVVfV3a27sA,0,I've yet tasted their cookies but have placed an order with them today (explains why I only gave 3 stars.
pDOpX4ScixFjVVfV3a27sA,1,"Will be back to edit my review) - And all cookie lovers NEED to know this: Unless I've been living under a rock, they are probably the 1st cookie bakery i know in Singapore that provides home-delivery service!"
pDOpX4ScixFjVVfV3a27sA,2,Famous Amos should follow in their foot steps.
pDOpX4ScixFjVVfV3a27sA,3,Can't wait for em to deliver my order!
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,0,I popped by The Gourmet Bakery Cafe just this afternoon for a cup of tea after some shopping at suntec city and millenia walk.
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,1,I was very happy with the service here and I ordered the Pasta.
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,2,"It wasn't the best I have tasted, but it definitely was of good quality."
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,3,The sandwiches here also aren't too bad and is reasonably priced!
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,4,For a cafe in Millenia Walk it is very reasonably priced which makes all the more reason for me to pop by the next time I am in the area!
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,5,The design of the store is very welcoming and embraces warm colours.
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,6,It is never too crowded which allows you to much peace and quiet which is very rare in this city.
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,7,The staff are very friendly and will even remember your name if your frequent enough!
KycNvdF9X8kznmz6G7YmHg,8,"Great place for some coffee and tea, definitely deserving of 4 stars!"
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,0,I was walking around millennia walk after going to comex.
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,1,Most of the cafes were packed and we walked around to see of there is anywhere without a queue.
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,2,We stumbled upon this rather quiet cafe tucked in a corner.
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,3,My friend ordered their pumpkin soup which was thick and rich.
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,4,It is very flavorful and we enjoyed it.
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,5,"On the other hand, I was very disappointed with their ultimate chocolate cake."
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,6,The cake was very dry.
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,7,It felt like the cake was left there and had dried up.
tH693l2rNU0D8Hi4yb9_Rg,8,There were a limited selection of cakes to choose from.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,0,I like coming here for cheap birthday cakes.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,1,A 300 gram cream cake here is priced at only $15.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,2,"It's enough to go round in my family of four, and reduces wastage."
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,3,500 gram cakes start from $22 and 1kg cakes from $32.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,4,"The fancier creamcakes will of course cost more, but the ones on display are good enough."
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,5,The quality of the cakes isn't compromised just because they're cheap.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,6,"They're soft, moist and melt in your mouth."
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,7,The durian buns here are a must-try.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,8,They come with a very generous amount of delicious durian pulp filling - three times the amount in Four Seasons' durian pancakes and are cheaper too!
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,9,I once committed the guilty pleasure of wolfing down six in one go.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,10,I usually wait till it's almost closing time to snap up bargains.
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,11,"From 8pm to 9pm, buns go at 3 for $3."
2Gc4_IneNeJxdxGCe3bgXg,12,Wait till 9pm and the remaining buns fly off the shelves at 4 for $3.
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,0,"As you know, I have a knack for the sweets-hence ""sweet tooth""."
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,1,And Bengawan Solo never failed to satisfy my sweet cravings.
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,2,"What I love about their pastries is that it is moist, and not too sweet."
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,3,Everything is just right.
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,4,"From the thickness of the layers, to the toppings."
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,5,"When I was introduced to this cake shop, I was hesitant at first because it has been a string of disappointments when it comes to me sampling sweet delicacies."
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,6,"When I tried their sticky rice cakes, it wasn't tough and dry, it was soft, moist, and easy to chew."
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,7,"Needless to say, I enjoy my sundays with anything from Bengawan Solo."
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,8,"Not only they are popular for their pastries, their price tags are very likeable."
S_PNxN2xgIwjQ3RlWwxRkg,9,As much as their dark red boxes.
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,0,It is rare for me to like catered food but the food all come piping hot!!
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,1,Even the otah smelled fresh off the bbq pit!!
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,2,"The fried Mee siam wasn't dry, and tasted pretty good!"
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,3,The otah had a nice burnt taste to it and didn't taste too artificial like some others from other catering companies.
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,4,"And this still comes in a leaf, most other companies have resorted to taking them out of the lead or just placing them in aluminum foil containers."
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,5,The drumlets were crispy and tasty!
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,6,I enjoyed the drumlets!
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,7,The black pepper fish had tons of mushrooms and it was not too peppery and it was savory.
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,8,The fish wasn't mushroom and almighty crispy on the edges.
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,9,The fruit cocktail for dessert was refreshing and was what we all needed after a long talk.
zKvKDMwS5dk_8VI_Jl2qYA,10,"Sadly there was no jelly in it, but I found it abit too diluted."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,0,Yong Tau Foo is one of my favourite meals at lunch because it can be made either very healthy or sinfully unhealthy.
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,1,"If I'm craving a healthy YTF, I head to the stall at the food court at the base of Golden Shoe."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,2,"They sell generous portions of freshly made fish cake wrapped in tofu skin and the servings of broccoli, carrots and Chinese vegetables are huge."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,3,"If I'm thinking of indulging in some unhealthy YTF, Jason's is it."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,4,Jason's is one of those old school hawkers that follows the belief that what's fried should be fried and whatever can't be fried is boiled.
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,5,You can find similar YTF at Telok Ayer St and the food court in Raffles City.
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,6,"I like Jason's because they offer a balance of freshly made items and factory made junk, in particular, their tau kua squares with chili fish paste, fried fish balls and fried tau pok can't be found at other stalls."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,7,"The soup base is ordinary and the laksa soup is diluted, so I'd recommend the former and ask for the fried items to be separated."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,8,There's an efficient system of ordering too.
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,9,"One line is for customers to choose their YTF, which you then pass to the lady at the back of the stall front to pay."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,10,She'll pass it down the line and you return to a second queue with a queue number to collect your food.
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,11,"The ""plating"" (which really is ""bowl-ing"") auntie will ask whether you want chilli and sweet sauce, then give you your bowl of YTF."
Oigg8XzWdfxDGsDERLj4wA,12,"So despite the long queues, ordering at Jason's is pretty smooth."
jXrYY3kpcr-yA4mHqBGHKQ,0,Inaugural yelpku: rice veg or porridge expensive yummy fish soup indoors aircon food
tgF8dx-i7Wi_1IKZbR6oeg,0,"This restaurant is actually part of the Night Safari, the place where you fill up on food before joining the hideously long line to jump on the tram."
tgF8dx-i7Wi_1IKZbR6oeg,1,"I came here because my tour group had booked up some of the tables for us, and also because it is a buffet restaurant (which seems to be common with tours - you can tell I haven't been on many)."
tgF8dx-i7Wi_1IKZbR6oeg,2,"The food is all Chinese, which is sort of odd because the name is African."
tgF8dx-i7Wi_1IKZbR6oeg,3,"Also they didn't have chop-sticks, though they do sell reasonably priced drinks, including Singapore Slings that don't break the bank."
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,0,"Four Leaves is awesome for two things: Its ""Mini World"" promotion and ability to whip up delicious, creamy cakes."
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,1,"The ""Mini World"" promotion consists of selected mini pastries and baked goods."
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,2,"Buy 1 piece for $0.70, 3 pieces for $1.95 and 5 pieces for just $2.95 (great deal)."
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,3,"You can choose from nutty brownies, sausage buns and many more!"
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,4,Now it's time for me to rave on about the cakes.
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,5,"Four Leaves, I believe, bakes some of the most gratifying cakes."
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,6,My top picks for cakes are Coco Exotic and Strawberry Shortcake.
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,7,"Loaded with silky chocolate mousse and hazelnut flakes, Coco Exotic is the perfect enjoyment amongst chocoholics."
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,8,"I favour creamy vanilla over chocolate, thus Strawberry Shortcake attains championship in my books!"
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,9,Its creamy texture and natural vanilla taste brings joy to my taste buds.
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,10,"The vanilla sponge layers are soft, complementing the huge strawberries and angelic vanilla cream."
4JYmdVm1xDpYH_R-AoqfYg,11,A dainty and lovely cake that is best enjoyed with a cup of tea!
CixCs6BKyWZtHQ3XBTu7CA,0,"Smitten is a branch opened by The Patissier, a home-grown bakery that has been making some of the most delectable cakes I've had."
CixCs6BKyWZtHQ3XBTu7CA,1,"While The Patissier is known for good, traditionally shaped cakes to cater to occasions like birthday parties and weddings, Smitten is dedicated to selling The Pattisier's best-selling item - the passion fruit meringue cake - in its intended form, in a roll."
CixCs6BKyWZtHQ3XBTu7CA,2,"The Passion-fruit meringue roll, otherwise known as Passionfruit Meringue Fame, is a must-try."
CixCs6BKyWZtHQ3XBTu7CA,3,The cream in the roulade was surprisingly light and subtly sweet and the fresh fruits in it offer a refreshing burst of flavour.
CixCs6BKyWZtHQ3XBTu7CA,4,"The meringue sponge was slightly crisp and crumbly, with just the right amount of sweetness!"
CixCs6BKyWZtHQ3XBTu7CA,5,No wonder it is a best-seller!
_C-QqJaQm1BY9fFViexvew,0,Mango pomelo sago taste ok only but the glutinous rice w coconut Icecream was nice and thick!
_C-QqJaQm1BY9fFViexvew,1,"Yuan yang paste - black sesame and almond - is a all time classic with its rich aroma, not too sweet."
_C-QqJaQm1BY9fFViexvew,2,Pretty crowded during dinner time as they serve food as well!
_C-QqJaQm1BY9fFViexvew,3,Look out for promotions such as '3 desserts for the price of 2' kinda thing.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,0,Spaces between tables are few cms apart.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,1,Nice way to dine with strangers.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,2,"And no, not much space for the strollers too."
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,3,Meh.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,4,We came with a full tummy & ordered 2 desserts.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,5,"They serve main dishes like wanton mee, rice etc."
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,6,Price of the desserts is reasonable for its portion.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,7,"Durian sago taste kinda strange, coconut ice cream with black glutinous rice is delicious."
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,8,It may not be a good choice on your first date as the black rice gets stuck in between your teeth.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,9,Hehe.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,10,"Try it on your second, yummy!"
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,11,3 stars because its not kids friendly.
w4fxOemTQ1DgOzbI6K9wXA,12,:( Edited: found baby chairs!
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,0,Seats and tables are very near each other.
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,1,Reminds me of dining in Hong Kong.
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,2,"Noodles, dumplings, roast pork, beef brisket, desserts."
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,3,"Noodles Â with roast pork, dumplings etc."
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,4,The mushroom pow looks fantastic.
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,5,Like real huge mushrooms.
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,6,"Due to the close proximity, you can makes friends without social media."
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,7,You can make small talk with strangers who sit just inches from you.
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,8,"Very homely feel, like in Hong Kong."
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,9,"But over there, nobody makes small talk or else they are scolding you."
PVdhcbtrZv9JLNByEfT7pw,10,Ha ha...
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,0,"Walking out from the MRT station into City Square Mall today, I was greeted with the pleasant aroma of freshly baked bread."
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,1,I could not help myself but stop at the source of the smell - Mugiya.
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,2,"They sell a pretty decent variety of buns and cakes and I had a taste of their cranberry cheese bun, which I heard was their specialty."
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,3,It was still warm when I bought it and was an absolute delight.
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,4,"The bread was soft and light, yet not too airy."
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,5,My only comment is that there could have been more cream cheese as I was eating plain bread in some of my bites.
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,6,Their chocolate buns are brilliant and their tiramisu is not too bad.
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,7,"While the tiramisu is not exactly the traditional ones you get in italy or in decent italian restaurants, it is light and has a nice coffee flavour."
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,8,Their buns and cakes are priced pretty average.
HjeXeSxSx93zSbFruJGCVQ,9,I can't remember how much the cakes cost but the cream cheese cranberry bun cost $1.50 which is pretty standard these days.
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,0,Cedele is a chain.
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,1,"It has dine-in restaurants, cafe-bakeries and just bakeries."
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,2,"I like this one at Jelita, because it's on the way home and it does what I need it to do without fuss and pretense, which is dispense one of my favorite sweets in the world, the caramel sea salt cheesecake."
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,3,"I generally don't get very excited about anything that doesn't have pork fat in it, so sweets are a bit of a hard sell with me."
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,4,This cheesecake is good.
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,5,How good?
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,6,"Well, it has no alcohol or pork fat in it and I adore it."
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,7,"Ok, not an endorsement that should mean much to you, oh stranger, but just take my word as a fellow Yelper, that it's worth my time and your calories."
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,8,The caramel has a vestigial smokiness that is accentuated and rounded off by the sea salt.
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,9,"In that first fresh slice, this flavor tango comes off as almost umami!"
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,10,"Weird, but good weird, like Kumar weird."
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,11,"Of course, this is a cheesecake after all Â and you get creamy and sweet and the graham crust is nice enough."
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,12,But it's that smoky-salt-sweet thing that gets me every time and keeps me coming back again and again to try and define the ethereal nature of this flavor etude.
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,13,So beguiling.
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,14,I'm almost thinking that an evil-boss garnish for this cake would be crisped bacon bits sprinkled lightly on.
WZEPxss2kYEkFUv-ojS3QA,15,"To prove this hypothesis, I think I need to head out for more research material...."
MtWjAj5ggMetx5yNs2Nzhw,0,This place is known for gyozas but I felt like the karrage was the worthy opponent.
MtWjAj5ggMetx5yNs2Nzhw,1,"It was crispy and flavorful, most things fried are maad delicious though."
MtWjAj5ggMetx5yNs2Nzhw,2,"Their fried rice has generous ingredients, with every bite, there is a good serving of spring onion,corn and pork or chicken."
MtWjAj5ggMetx5yNs2Nzhw,3,This lunch set brings a good food coma and you be satisfied with the wok hei of the rice.
MtWjAj5ggMetx5yNs2Nzhw,4,"Not pictured here, a peppery egg drop soup to end off the meal!"
LKpoukbGVwD8T1O6SfXVbw,0,"One of the few bakeries in Singapore that still sells gai zai beng, except during festive seasons like Chinese new year when they focus on making other baked goods."
LKpoukbGVwD8T1O6SfXVbw,1,"Their gai zai beng is a great combination of crunchy and chewy, savoury and sweet, exactly how I like my cookies and is awesome as a TV snack."
LKpoukbGVwD8T1O6SfXVbw,2,"At just $2.50 for a box of 5 or 6, it is totally worth it."
LKpoukbGVwD8T1O6SfXVbw,3,"Sin Tong Nam also offers green bean cakes, ji dan gao (the big soft ones, not the kueh balus), walnut cookies and a few others."
LKpoukbGVwD8T1O6SfXVbw,4,There isn't a lot of variety but they do the few things very well.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,0,My flight leaving for JFK put me at Changi Airport Terminal 3.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,1,"Once I went through immigration, I saw PAUL right next to the Duty Free for cosmetics & fragrances."
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,2,The best part was it seemed to me there were many empty tables & chairs.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,3,I usually like to arrive for my flight early giving ample time to clear immigration or security checks.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,4,I could use a pastry and some tea at PAUL before I headed to the gate.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,5,There was no one at the front/checkout counter but eventually one staff emerged from the back.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,6,Just said she was not very cheery and rather grumpy.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,7,It seemed that she was the only person working.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,8,I placed my order and tried to create conversations with her.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,9,She was less grumpy by the end of my transaction.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,10,I guess it would be really hard to be mean to someone who usually in good spirits and polite at all times.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,11,"After the staff placed my order on a tray, I looked around for tables."
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,12,"Yep, there were many empty tables but many of them had dirty plates or empty soda bottles or used paper cups on them."
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,13,"Worse, some of those chairs were really stained."
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,14,How those pretty chairs got stained that badly was beyond my comprehension.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,15,Guess clearing & cleaning those tables are not the strongest point for this PAUL here.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,16,And those chairs seriously need a good shampoo.
nQDZJNMq_vsWsaXi5B_BnA,17,I love the fruit tartlet and the peppermint tea though.
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,0,Haagen Daz continous to win hearts of both young and old with their ice cream that takes a long time to melt.
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,1,"Although they maybe just as any other ice cream, I guarantee you, you need to take a spoonful of it before confirming your decision with a gavel."
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,2,"When I have ice cream, I go for the usual chocolate or vanilla."
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,3,"But with Haagen Daz, I go for their strawberry fields."
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,4,It doesn't tast artificial at all.
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,5,You can taste real strawberry goodness and enjoy every last bite without that puddle of then-ice cream.
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,6,"Hence, nothing goes to waste."
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,7,"For an ice crea, it can be quite expensive."
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,8,But it never hurts to indulge once in a blue moon.
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,9,"And by the time you decide to have a dose of Haagen, they maybe promoting a new flavour."
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,10,"Looking at the store, you may think that Haagen Daz may not be good of an ice cream because of its almost deserted place."
_TluIj5qA5dt4NSPgOw1YA,11,"But think about it, what time does ice cream lovers get out of school?"
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,0,This version of the beloved traditional soya beancurd seems to be taking over the food scene here in Singapore.
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,1,"Many stores offering this new silky, pudding-like soya beancurd have been popping up around the island at almost every food centre and to be honest, they all taste rather similar."
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,2,"69 Cold Soya Beancurd is a new store recently set up in Kovan, selling soya beancurd and soya milk drinks."
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,3,I found the soya milk drink rather diluted compared to the others that I have tried.
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,4,"The soya beancurd is comparable to most of the rest, very soft and silky."
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,5,They have recently introduced a durian flavoured soya beancurd and I had a go at it.
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,6,I'm not a great fan of flavoured soya beancurd so the durian flavoured one did not go too well for me.
1OEAJ05D-PYel0LNOHO4Zw,7,I found the taste a little artificial and I guess I will be sticking to the original one from now on.
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,0,"The name of this store brought to mine the cheesy ""Coffee, tea or, me?"""
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,1,pick-up line.
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,2,"It occupies the former Sweettalk shop, smack in the middle of a neighbourhood shopping centre where nobody bothers to dress up to the nines, so it isn't a very romantic option for a date."
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,3,"There's no coffee but plenty of flavoured bubble teas, waffles and many types of flavoured beancurd."
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,4,I got their yam beancurd and honey waffle.
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,5,They tasted pretty good.
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,6,The waffle was made fresh and isn't too thick and the yam beancurd just slid down my throat.
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,7,"The shop only sells chilled beancurd though, warm options are not available."
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,8,"I like mine chilled, so this doesn't bother me."
fPtOQtsR3uwzfzTEzhL-Jw,9,"Their tau huay is also produced with a non-dairy recipe, so the lactose-intolerant ones can enjoy it too."
IPR-qNHe1CFbIyj_dhSVjA,0,Sweetest Moments specializes in full month (manyue) and wedding packages for friends and relatives as well as cupcakes for all occasions.
IPR-qNHe1CFbIyj_dhSVjA,1,"Last year, I ordered my baby girl's full month packages, cake and cupcakes."
IPR-qNHe1CFbIyj_dhSVjA,2,"The full month package consist of red eggs, Ang ku kueh, bite size cakes and mochi that is nicely box up with a personalized announcement card (which can be a keepsake)."
IPR-qNHe1CFbIyj_dhSVjA,3,The friends and relatives who received them loved the special touch even though it may not be the most delicious.
IPR-qNHe1CFbIyj_dhSVjA,4,Check out their cupcakes too.
IPR-qNHe1CFbIyj_dhSVjA,5,They have one interesting item which is the tear apart cupcake cake.
IPR-qNHe1CFbIyj_dhSVjA,6,"It is being presented like a ""whole cake"" yet you can tear apart the cake for easy distribution."
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,0,New ice cream joint in Joo Chiat.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,1,It's a little hard to notice because it's above the Shop & Save.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,2,You'll have to look for the glass door around the back and go up the escalator to find it.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,3,The place is a little small and I would only recommend you to takeaway your dessert because it's not a place you can have a sit and savour your dessert over a cup of tea.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,4,"Also, they don't have much flavours available so just expect the regular favourites like dark chocolate, vanilla, rum & raisin."
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,5,"They also have sorbets - lemon, strawberry and mint (if i remember correctly)."
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,6,I got the dark chocolate on a cone while le bf had the rum & raisin on a cone too.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,7,The dark chocolate was pretty nice.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,8,Doesn't really taste like dark chocolate though.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,9,Maybe I expected a stronger flavour but it just tasted like really rich regular chocolate ice cream.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,10,Flavour was ok and satisfying but that was it.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,11,The rum & raisin though was a bit of a dud.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,12,The texture was a bit sedimentary and it tasted like the flavours wasn't mixed up well enough.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,13,"Plus, it wasn't really creamy either."
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,14,Give this place a miss if you're looking for dessert in Joo Chiat.
sp3Daaw3dBUBVUj5xK9ZyA,15,There are plenty more which are better.
I1X-kTLbrJUMIQM9EY1kPw,0,"They have hot and cold desserts here, but my favourite reason to visit this place is for the Taiwan-style shaved ice desserts - solid in appearance but disappearing once you put it in your mouth."
I1X-kTLbrJUMIQM9EY1kPw,1,"I got myself a milo shaved ice, which was freshly ground up and topped off with milo powder and condensed milk, yum!"
I1X-kTLbrJUMIQM9EY1kPw,2,"Not that cheap though at $4.20, but so very good especially on a hot day."
I1X-kTLbrJUMIQM9EY1kPw,3,"They've got other more traditional flavours like sesame, mango and green tea, but who doesn't love milo!"
I1X-kTLbrJUMIQM9EY1kPw,4,There is some seating at this outlet so you can enjoy your desserts freshly prepared.
nd70W5wCnK-6mAeU757PcQ,0,This place is ok.
nd70W5wCnK-6mAeU757PcQ,1,I had the curry chicken.
nd70W5wCnK-6mAeU757PcQ,2,"I wasn't expecting bones, but the curry itself was good :)) I'll try something else next time."
H3qgruQtAun7ND2qzWuaKA,0,The Lao ban style beancurd.
H3qgruQtAun7ND2qzWuaKA,1,But this version is much sweeter.
H3qgruQtAun7ND2qzWuaKA,2,The only reason why we ate this is because it is the one that is still opened at 3am.
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,0,"Great, great desserts and a yummy place to get local and Indonesian specialities."
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,1,Growing up with all the traditional Kueh - it's always nice to walk by and just grab a few - even if it's just one or 2 pieces.
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,2,From Ondeh-Ondeh to modern cream cakes - this chain offers quite a selection.
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,3,"What I Love: My fave ones are the traditional options - from Ondeh-Ondeh, Talam Ubi, Kueh Salat, Dodol, Kueh Bugis, Corn Kueh, Kueh Jongkong, Sago Melaka Â to Pulut Inti - it's really a plethora of flavors."
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,4,"If you want something less traditional, you could get the famous Pandan Sponge Cake, Swissroll and a few other cakes."
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,5,Prices are affordable - and they'll pack it really nicely for you - depending on whether you're taking some overseas or for a party.
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,6,I brought quite a bit of Kueh to Australia - and they were totally fine!
L4OUvLh6Ba6Z7QApcV5EAA,7,What I Don't Love: The good ones or certain types finish pretty early - so good to buy in bulk or get down earlier in the day.
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,0,"Among my friends, no one had the time to queue to check out the hype and someone has to sacrifice right?"
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,1,I heard about the snaking queue and honestly was expecting out-of-the-world doughnuts.
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,2,"I mean, look at the length of the queue at 4pm!"
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,3,"Even at this hour, I had to wait for 50 mins."
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,4,Don't get me wrong.
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,5,The original doughnuts taste good.
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,6,"Something like you could get at Donut Factory (okay, I know they have closed)."
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,7,Soft and fluffy.
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,8,But they are just... very ordinary.
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,9,So wait for the novelty to die down and buy.
mFlLihzNynxSXHyEpCdo-w,10,It's really not worth the queuing time:)
SRKshzzNR2ahDpWtXEEEEA,0,For years people have been hoping to try the famous Krispy Kreme in Singapore as it's fame has travelled a long way from the USA.
SRKshzzNR2ahDpWtXEEEEA,1,Now it's finally here!
SRKshzzNR2ahDpWtXEEEEA,2,For me personally I find it too sweet and sugary.
SRKshzzNR2ahDpWtXEEEEA,3,"It's nice still, don't get me wrong, but a far cry from those in the US."
SRKshzzNR2ahDpWtXEEEEA,4,I think the franchising quality has to be upped one level.
O5sUhR4cam04SxPpDWpsOA,0,Queued up for ~15mins and bought these KK donuts as it was the craze!
O5sUhR4cam04SxPpDWpsOA,1,My family and some friends all felt that it was waaaaay too sweet!
O5sUhR4cam04SxPpDWpsOA,2,Personally felt like I was a step closer to diabetes with every bite... Just imagine a sugar explosion in your mouth!
O5sUhR4cam04SxPpDWpsOA,3,Don't think that it's worth the money and time...
O5sUhR4cam04SxPpDWpsOA,4,I will not buy these donuts again.
O5sUhR4cam04SxPpDWpsOA,5,"If you really really are curious to try it, perhaps you can when you fly to other countries where they sell it cheaper :-) *E.g."
O5sUhR4cam04SxPpDWpsOA,6,Thailand - Bangkok (27 donuts for SGD20) 1/5 stars for me!
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,0,Frolick sports a yummy green color that pops out to attract your attention.
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,1,They have the usual yogurt and toppings.
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,2,But what I did love was the blueberry-flavoured yogurt.
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,3,"The place is too small to accommodate people who want to hang around the place but if you're like me who likes walking while eating their yogurt, then this maybe a place for you."
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,4,"For an average of $8 for a regular cup, you get your choice of either a regular yogurt or the blueberry one and a topping of your choice."
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,5,I opted for the blueberry yogurt and muesli toppings.
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,6,I do think both flavours went well together.
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,7,"The blueberry complemented the muesli, which was mainly composed of dried fruits."
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,8,"Hence, I could say that my first attempt to mix them was a success-and I'm glad I did not choose chocolate or caramel or butterscotch."
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,9,"For me, Frolick was there at a perfect time when I was looking for comfort food on a different level."
81mniSOnUlqe6XNZ-X3MQQ,10,So it is best enjoyed maybe on a weekly basis.
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,0,"The Icing Room serves a range of desserts, such as cakes and muffins."
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,1,The waiters are dressed in pink candy-like costumes (which I always disliked) and the service standards at Compass Point are rather good.
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,2,"They are friendly and helpful, giving you recommendations and whats not."
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,3,"Sometimes, they can be a little pushy in selling their products though."
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,4,The Icing Room is also known for their DIY birthday cake decoration.
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,5,"There are three sizes of cakes to choose from and you can purchase their decoration kit which includes pipping bags with coloured creams, some sweet decorations and all."
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,6,I've seen kids as young as 3 years old decorating the cake for their grandparents.
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,7,It's a pretty cool activity and it helps build creativity too!
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,8,"In terms of cake standards, I wouldn't say its damn good."
gzZYWTnkPJGx0mZbTmYZ0Q,9,It's just normal and can get a little too sweet for my liking.
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,0,This food treat that I'm about to share with you can be found almost everywhere in Singapore.
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,1,"And frankly, this unique way of enjoying this cold dessert is so exciting; you just can't get enough of it."
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,2,"You may have seen those ice cream kiosks around selling blocks of ice cream, sandwiched between wafers or bread."
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,3,This is potong ice cream.
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,4,"Locals may have a different term for this, but just to make it clear to anyone non-local, I would coin it as ""Potong Ice Cream"" so you'd know what I'm talking about."
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,5,The first time I had a taste of this local treat is during my walk with a friend along Orchard Road.
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,6,"I had cookies and cream at that time, placed between wafer sheets."
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,7,"Some prefer the bread, but for me, I get to enjoy this dessert with wafers because I get the flavor and creaminess of the ice cream, and that crunchy bite along with it."
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,8,"Whenever my friends would come and visit me here, I always take them to a Potong Kiosk because this is a perfect, laid back way to enjoy a local dessert while hanging out with them."
PbJ-Bx4iFWLe4bhQtF3ffg,9,"For just $1, you'll definitely be satisfied in this delicious block of ice cream with your choice of wafer or bread."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,0,"I'm not sure if the reviews of Sour Sally from Orchard share the same sentiments, but the Jurong Point outlet was disappointing for me."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,1,I saw sour sally while walking around Jurong Point one day and decided to give it a try.
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,2,"Now, while I am not a regular yogurt eater, I do feel that this Sour Sally outlet in Jurong does seem to top the list of poor yogurts in Singapore."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,3,"I ordered the small ""twist"" with mango toppings (twist refers to green tea mixed with original) at a student special price (10% off for students) at around $5."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,4,"Pricey was my first thought and ""hopefully it's good"" was my second."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,5,I dug in and found it to be extremely watery and has poor consistency unlike regular yogurts.
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,6,"At that point, I wondered if I had bought sour ice instead of yogurt."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,7,"The mango toppings seemed to be slightly over-ripe, but not a problem for me."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,8,"To commend on the green tea flavor, it does not taste much like green tea and does seem to be poorly flavored."
qEDJXIZ3SWofv4t0eB8aGA,9,"About 5 minutes in, I gave up as a significant part of the yogurt melted into watery consistency."
hyOgOBbf3QVi-nuHYcszQA,0,I won't come back to this place.
hyOgOBbf3QVi-nuHYcszQA,1,Ordered Kolo Noodle and Nyonya Chicken Rice.
hyOgOBbf3QVi-nuHYcszQA,2,"So the Kolo noodle is way too dry and so we asked for some soup and after 3 times of reminder to the aunty, she said there is only 1 Chef and he will make ours after some customer."
hyOgOBbf3QVi-nuHYcszQA,3,"Came the soup, it is hot water with some soya source, oil and spring onions in it."
hyOgOBbf3QVi-nuHYcszQA,4,You can see the soya source is not even stirred properly.
hyOgOBbf3QVi-nuHYcszQA,5,"Just too ignorant and didn't know what is right or wrong, no common sense."
HTwqxU44I4kVGnem2dCCzQ,0,Located inside the Heartland Mall where we go have lunch sometimes; it was still too early for the shuttle (work provides the service) to get back so we wandered around the mall.
HTwqxU44I4kVGnem2dCCzQ,1,"No storefront, it is a kiosk."
HTwqxU44I4kVGnem2dCCzQ,2,The baked goods looked enticing.
HTwqxU44I4kVGnem2dCCzQ,3,"The prices are great so I justified my purchases on these points: I was still hungry, it's cheap, I ran in the morning, and I need chocolate."
HTwqxU44I4kVGnem2dCCzQ,4,Cash only.
HTwqxU44I4kVGnem2dCCzQ,5,Both of the zebra bun and chocolate / custard bun was dry and the chocolate tastes like it has been inside its flaky shell for hella long.
HTwqxU44I4kVGnem2dCCzQ,6,I did not want a refund on money but I wanted my calories back.
HdpiK4zM8YharHQbDzv78Q,0,This is a bar and restaurant tucked away in the hollywood part of universal studios.
HdpiK4zM8YharHQbDzv78Q,1,"The service is terrible, but the only redeeming factor about this place is that it is relatively empty compared to the rest of USS, and it is nice to take a breather from the crowds."
HdpiK4zM8YharHQbDzv78Q,2,"I ordered the caesar salad (18 bucks), and it was actually surprisingly good by Singapore salad standards."
HdpiK4zM8YharHQbDzv78Q,3,"At the very least, they had anchovies, and the dressing was flavorful."
HdpiK4zM8YharHQbDzv78Q,4,My friend ordered nachos which he really liked.
HdpiK4zM8YharHQbDzv78Q,5,The house white wine was delicious as well.
HdpiK4zM8YharHQbDzv78Q,6,"Judging from the lack of customers, I don't think this place will be around for long, but if you are an easy spender, and want some okay food at an inflated price in peace in USS, this is your place."
eKX6pma7ffBgxf5pZI0KUA,0,'Meh.
eKX6pma7ffBgxf5pZI0KUA,1,I've experienced better' really sums up this place for me.
eKX6pma7ffBgxf5pZI0KUA,2,I had been looking forward to try their buns for awhile as the constant sweet smells that waft from this bakery everytime I walk past it are soooo tempting.
eKX6pma7ffBgxf5pZI0KUA,3,"But sadly, it wasn't as good as I expected."
eKX6pma7ffBgxf5pZI0KUA,4,"In their defence it might be because I imagine it to taste a certain way before I had even tried it based on the smell and the cinnamon buns that I had had in the past, but the chocolate and cinnamon buns from this place that I had were so so sweet, honestly I couldn't taste much past the sugar that was in the bun."
eKX6pma7ffBgxf5pZI0KUA,5,"It really didn't do it for me, but I admit it might do it for others!"
eKX6pma7ffBgxf5pZI0KUA,6,To me it was more a desert than a cinnamon bun or roll - which should be more bread than cake like.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,0,Lady M has been on my mind for a while and I had never got the chance to taste their crepe cakes when they were in Marina Square.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,1,"Luckily, they came closer to the West and there is no reason skipping the cafe now."
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,2,Cafe is conveniently located in Westgate at the same level of Jurong East MRT station control exit.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,3,Interior of Lady M give a comfortable feeling to diners with its white theme color and spacious environment.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,4,Dusted with the earthy green fine matcha powder on each and every layer of the paper thin crepe with the natural bitter aftertaste.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,5,I'm pretty impress by the thin crepe layers spread with Japanese style pastry cream on every layers and was so grateful that the texture was so good that it literally melts in my mouth.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,6,"Green Tea Mille Crepes - $9 The boutique exclusive, only available in West Gate!"
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,7,The twenty thin layers of handmade crepes and refreshingly light chestnut-kissed pastry cream sandwiched in between the layers with .
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,8,"Topped with powdered sugar and with good notes of roasted chestnuts, this is indeed a rare find!"
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,9,"Marron Mille Crepes - $9 Skipping the cold beverages, I opted for Chamomile Dream in a pot at $5.50."
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,10,It was indeed good drink for me to keep my stomach warm as I was having stomach upset.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,11,Tea is plain and Sweetness can be adjusted with the sugar cubes given.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,12,Chamomile Dream - $5.50 My friend order the caffe latte to pair along with the crepes.
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,13,"To be frank, with just crepes and drinks, we were really done for the night, skipping the dinner."
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,14,"Mille Crepe cakes are my favorite and with the choices of flavour chosen, I would say the sweetness was at right amount."
YpAQ2GkGPJMluwN12n_GWg,15,I dont mind visiting again for other flavours of cakes or even their pastries.
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,0,"Before my visit to this outlet, Lady M was in my mind for quite some time, as I wanted to try out the cakes."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,1,"Most of the times I walked past this place, it was crowded so finally with another yelper, I got to visit this outlet with only 4 customers including ourselves."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,2,You would expect service to be top notch since there was a same number of staff .
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,3,"1:1 ratio, that shouldn't be too difficult right?"
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,4,"Instead, the staff seemed to have their mind elsewhere as they were standing at a corner most of the time chit chatting away."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,5,"Lots of waving and calling out for them, it took a while to grab hold of their attention."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,6,A few seconds more I would have walked over to call them.
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,7,"As some of you know that I am very particular in customer service and for this, this is completely unacceptable."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,8,"Imagine if this is a full house, can't imagine how worse the service is."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,9,Even calling for the bill was a challenge.
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,10,"As for the cakes, they are pretty decent."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,11,"I have tasted similar cakes in other countries, I find this to be maybe 6,5/10, the price is around $9 per slice, a bit expensive for my liking."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,12,At least the portion is reasonable.
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,13,"Overall, I am not in a hurry to return and if I do, I hope to see an improvement in the service."
jJ-_wknuM5Al5LJlQnAfcA,14,"Whether there are customers or not, the staff has to keep in mind that job comes first, they can leave their conversation during their break or after office hours."
RjCfLYanVtgKv5DMYxMVUw,0,The milk crepe tasted great and came in a decent portion.
RjCfLYanVtgKv5DMYxMVUw,1,I had the green tea version.
RjCfLYanVtgKv5DMYxMVUw,2,The cream went very well with each thin crepe and the top layer had sprinkling of powder.
RjCfLYanVtgKv5DMYxMVUw,3,The amount of green tea flavour was just right to satisfy green tea fans like me and also make it appealing to those who may not particularly like green tea.
RjCfLYanVtgKv5DMYxMVUw,4,"The reason why I didn't give more stars is that I find the price a tad expensive even though the quality is good and the service can be improved, for e.g."
RjCfLYanVtgKv5DMYxMVUw,5,"Staff can be more attentive and quicker, starting with putting a sign to indicate which side the queue starts from at the entrance!"
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,0,Would agree with the low ratings many fellow Yelpers have given this one-truly overly hyped and overpriced.
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,1,"Ordered the set ($35++) which came with 2 cakes, 2 drinks and 2 choux puffs."
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,2,The crepe cakes were not anything special-though we had the seasonal specials which were the chocolate raspberry and the passion fruit.
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,3,"If anything, the cakes got cloying after a while and did not appeal both visually and taste wise."
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,4,"The choux puffs were an ultimate disappointment, with the white chocolate shells being too hard and the pastry itself almost a rock."
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,5,The cream inside failed to impress-save for the fact that it was especially hard and left a deep impression as something one would find in the frozen section of a supermarket (on sale).
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,6,"Overall, I'm glad I made the trip down to confirm the bad reviews."
wdEg58W957OeBgncxmWiQg,7,"Similarly, I've tried it once, but never again."
qRJJyeOFr81b-L2EJcKiiA,0,Highly questionable hygiene standards.
qRJJyeOFr81b-L2EJcKiiA,1,Overpriced and quality is 1/5.
qRJJyeOFr81b-L2EJcKiiA,2,Dropped a sandwich on the floor and I actually believe they attempted to put it back on the rack for sale.
qRJJyeOFr81b-L2EJcKiiA,3,Definitely not on my list of bread shops to visit anytime in the near future.
kgvrwl5Pjt7wQskIuXsbfw,0,"Once you have had Yamazaki bread, you would never eat anything else again."
kgvrwl5Pjt7wQskIuXsbfw,1,"Previously found only in Japanese shopping centers and supermarkets, the west-enders have now been treated to good Japanese style bread as Yamazaki opens a branch in the new JCube shopping mall at Jurong East."
kgvrwl5Pjt7wQskIuXsbfw,2,It is no surprise when my mom in law exclaimed her delight at the wonderful taste and texture of the bread and questioned why she has never seen the brand before.
kgvrwl5Pjt7wQskIuXsbfw,3,The bread is soft and you will find Japanese favorites - whole red bean - in your bread instead of your usual pork floss favorites.
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,0,I had cravings for beancurd and bought four bowls from Bean Basic as it was the nearest soy stall in the area.
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,1,I was too lazy to walk over to Mr Bean.
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,2,"Besides soya bean drinks, they have beancurd in four flavours - plain, pandan, mango and strawberry."
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,3,"Might as well try out all four, I thought."
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,4,"I got them all cold because I like my beancurd chilled, not warm."
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,5,The plain Â flavour was okay and slid down my throat Â nicely.
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,6,"I can't say the same for mango and strawberry - they came in a nice canary yellow and candyfloss pink, but there the taste didn't match up."
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,7,There was no hint of the fruits!
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,8,The owner probably just added food colouring.
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,9,The pandan was the best - fragrant and tasted good.
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,10,Strong presence of pandan.
tXK-piLDe3GYXjfohvzxPQ,11,"I would come back here for the pandan beancurd, but not for the other flavours."
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,0,Had Bakerzin with my friends at Paragon a few times.
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,1,One thing I am a big fan of are obviously their desserts!
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,2,I must say their souffle which costs less than $12 is quite worth it and quite well done.
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,3,Their cakes are also not bad.
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,4,"As I have already tried two of the best (LadurÃ©e and Pierre HermÃ©') macaroons in the world already, my standards for macaroons are quite high and Bakerzin's macaroons may not be as awesome as LadurÃ©e and Pierre HermÃ©, but it was still considered quite delicious."
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,5,"Or maybe because I am a sucker for desserts, as long as it looks nice and smell, doesn't fall apart, have a balance taste of the flavor and have a nice sticky chewy center, I will consider it a good macaroon."
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,6,"Their mooncakes are also quite delicious and if I am not wrong, mid-autumn festival will be coming quite soon so it's quite a good time to see what kind of mooncake they will put out this year."
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,7,Their main courses are also not bad.
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,8,I have tried their fish and pasta before and it's quite healthy and delicious.
0XS1Jd4sAjaeUfDGKCWBtQ,9,"It's a good place for a small group of friends to hang out for lunch, high tea or dinner."
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,0,Affordable place with decent Chinese food.
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,1,I like the noodle dishes.
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,2,The noodles are cooked to the right softness.
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,3,I prefer the soupy options than the ones with gravy which I find a bit salty.
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,4,I recommend the custard buns and shrimp dumplings.
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,5,You can make your meal a set by topping up $2 for carrot cake and yuan yang paste.
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,6,The branch in Clementi is open until quite late- I saw customers around 10pm too.
fXllqYqz6YPWgKwDlomMkg,7,"Late night supper/dessert, anyone?"
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,0,This little Portuguese bakery in the basement of 313@Somerset artfully displays its wares behind glass for all to see.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,1,"However I didn't see much space for baking, so the goods are most likely not made onsite, which probably explains much of what I am going to say."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,2,"So far, I've tried 10 of its pastries."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,3,First was the Ham & Cheese Panike.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,4,It was heavy and doughy and the (chicken) ham and cheese were very mild tasting.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,5,The crumb had a slightly buttery flavour so it was slightly better than the contents.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,6,"The (chicken) rissole (fried dough with stuffing) was alright, but the outside was a little greasy, and the interior less creamy than I would have liked (it was a little dry, actually)."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,7,"The coconut bun had a tasty candied shredded coconut topping, but it was let down by its crumb which was heavy, dense and flavourless."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,8,"The chocolate ""doughssant"" (aka cronut) had a rich chocolate coating (whose taste had splashes of gianduja [chocolate-hazelnut])."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,9,Its body was acceptable but was rather far from the light flakiness that croissant clones aspire to.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,10,"The strawberry doughssant was worse, with artificial tasting strawberry cream and with a stale and un-flaky body (I had it on a different day so maybe the chocolate ones were bad that day too)."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,11,I didn't even care to finish mine.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,12,"The cream eclair's body was a little stale and quite dry, though the cream topping was alright."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,13,The pineapple cornucopia had a very heavy crumb which was hard to bite - a small drop of cream actually dropped onto my shirt as my teeth struggled to tear off a bite-sized morsel of the cornucopia.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,14,The pineapple was very hard to taste and the cream was dry.
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,15,"The Palmier was also disappointing, being obviously stale."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,16,"It probably tasted much better when fresh, and the texture would've resembled the wonderfully flaky cheese sticks that Le Cafe used to make in the 90s but doesn't anymore."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,17,"The custard that was between the pastry layers was alright, but didn't taste very fresh."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,18,"The Berlin Ball puzzled me at first, not least since it looked very different from Berliners (being filled with custard instead of jam) but I've since learned that this is the Portuguese variant."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,19,Once again the dough was heavy (in fact many of their doughs taste like something that'd come out of a traditional Singaporean Chinese bakery - even if the filling is different).
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,20,"The custard was a little too sweet and heavy, though that might be how it's supposed to be."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,21,"The Portuguese egg tart started off with a pleasant cinammon hit, and the pastry was warm (the lady took it from the back instead of one of the cold ones from behind the glass) but the pastry was rather mushy and remained flaky only at the sides."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,22,"In fact, KFC's Portuguese egg tarts have a better crust."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,23,"The custard was alright - milky and full-flavoured, but not quite silky enough and just a touch too sweet."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,24,"While the quality of the products here isn't very good, $1.20 each for mini pastries (and $3 for 3) is a pretty good deal."
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,25,"And we're all tired of the Japanese bakeries and traditional Singaporean Chinese bakeries that we find everywhere, aren't we?"
7iYyAuULGhbvOuz1wANL7A,26,And we can't find Tiong Bahru Bakery or Artisan Boulangerie Co everywhere (and would like a break from French artifice occasionally).
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,0,They couldn't have come up with a more apt name for their business.
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,1,"This tiny store near Bukit Gombak MRT station offers a wide variety of halal pastries, cakes and cookies to satisfy your sweet tooth."
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,2,Their mini savouries are flaky and disappear in two bites.
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,3,It would be better if they had spicier fillings!
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,4,"For a small store, Indulge Patisserie has an extensive range of cakes to choose from."
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,5,"There are mini cakes for those who just want to sample different flavours or have a small dessert, and bigger ones for celebrations."
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,6,"Their best-seller, Chocolate Fantasy, is rich and chocolatey with a smooth texture."
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,7,Customers can also place orders for favours with the store.
GytZft_SFUW4uqH7lUNI0w,8,"It helps that while the products here are good, the prices don't break the bank."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,0,"Approximately about 2 years ago, I was introduced by my uncle to this cold and frozen taufufa."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,1,"Initially, I was a little bit skeptical for the fact that it is cold."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,2,I don't take cold taufufa; it is just not my thing.
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,3,I always have my taufufa fresh and hot back in KL.
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,4,"Since I saw a crowd of young and even old people waiting for their cold taufufa, I gave it a shot."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,5,"My mother on the other hand, was skeptical like me as well but we took a step to brave through our curiosity and tried it."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,6,"At first, I wasn't used to it as it's cold but trust me on this when I say that this is one of the best taste taufufa I ever had in my entire life!"
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,7,"Well at the moment, it is the best cold tautufa I ever had."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,8,It is not too sweet nor is it too bland.
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,9,"It is just nice for my liking, which is quite surprising as I never discovered this dessert joint."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,10,The best part would be the soft beancurd and for the fact that it is organic (seriously you will never be able to taste coloring and preservatives).
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,11,"I went to the point where I didn't want to leave Skudai, Johor for this taufufa."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,12,This was how bad I wanted to consume the taufufa.
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,13,Little did I know that Kulai Lou Pan has opened many branches across Malaysia.
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,14,"So, if you wish to pamper your sweet tooth, head on to Kulai Lou Pan."
lKIIProZP1L2dF-BoR_xDQ,15,"In the Klang Valley, there are 2 branches which are in Puchong and Kepong!"
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,0,"Like any gourmet bakery, this charming little shop bakes tasty goodies, fit for a king."
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,1,You'll find perfect-looking buns & loaves of bread and pretty cakes here.
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,2,Surprisingly the prices here were not that high.
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,3,I like the scones which are 4 for $3.10.
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,4,I bought some baguettes from them once while on my way home after a meeting.
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,5,"They were perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously soft on the inside, just the way I like them."
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,6,I've been coming back here Â for baguettes ever since.
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,7,"Managed by Four Leaves' Group of Companies, the bakery has promotional prices for selected items from time to time, and their cakes taste good too."
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,8,My favourite is the Coco Exotic which has a little crunch to it.
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,9,YUMM!
vHXdVqrjVwD0LFSKpvqLJQ,10,!
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,0,I have been limiting my self to eating bread beside wheat bread.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,1,So I basically never bought a bread in this shop.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,2,"But unlike normal bakeries, they have another corner selling HK style dim sum like carrot cake, chicken wing, Wife biscuit and etc."
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,3,And that's where my money goes to.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,4,Carrot cake is another of my weak point so normally I can't resist buying carrot cake if the shop sells one.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,5,The carrot cake they sell is not the kind I like.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,6,They have chinese sausage inside which to me is not a good combination.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,7,Once in awhile I will still get one to eat.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,8,There are promotions going on everyday after 5.30pm so you will see working adults buying some bread home for breakfast the next day.
m5MFI3G4WbVmahJmbCyVQA,9,Freeze Bun are also available for own consumption at home.
Az2elMG5nqP696qCl-aAHQ,0,It was refreshing to have a break from the usual chain bakeries in Singapore.
Az2elMG5nqP696qCl-aAHQ,1,This bakery offers a variety of bread with an impressive number of unique ingredients and health benefits.
Az2elMG5nqP696qCl-aAHQ,2,The loaves are affordable whereas the individual bread can be a bit pricey.
Az2elMG5nqP696qCl-aAHQ,3,I tried the bamboo charcoal loaf and found it quite bland.
Az2elMG5nqP696qCl-aAHQ,4,The chocolate buns fared much better.
Az2elMG5nqP696qCl-aAHQ,5,"Hope that this bakery will stay around to increase choices for consumers, especially health-conscious ones."
b7pgYPZg8vUoYSzSiRnWdg,0,The egg-tarts here are to die for!
b7pgYPZg8vUoYSzSiRnWdg,1,"Always fresh, the tarts are made without lard and thus don't have the lardy oily taste that some egg tarts have."
b7pgYPZg8vUoYSzSiRnWdg,2,"Not overly sweet, the custard is smooth and light, and the pastry is flaky and crisp."
b7pgYPZg8vUoYSzSiRnWdg,3,Their tarts are made without preservatives and artificial colouring and they maintain their level of freshess by having a special promotion at the end of the day to clear the remaining tarts.
b7pgYPZg8vUoYSzSiRnWdg,4,"They also offer soya egg tarts for the more health conscious consumer, Â it doesn't taste as good to me but it should appeal to those who are a little more health conscious."
b7pgYPZg8vUoYSzSiRnWdg,5,"There are also durian, banana and chocolate egg tarts for variety - I prefer the traditional egg tarts but appreciate these fun additions :) Their savoury pastries are also yummy and not too oily - my favourites are the Roast Chicken Polo Bun and the Mushroom Chicken Pie."
b7pgYPZg8vUoYSzSiRnWdg,6,"Although a small establishment that only does take-aways, it is definately worth a try if you are in the area."
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,0,"After finishing my Friday's mass prayer at a mosque, my tummy started to rumble as though it's complaining for food."
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,1,"In response, I went to a nearby bakery shop called 'Swee Heng Bakery'."
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,2,"Upon entering, I was greeted with a whiff of delicious pastry that sent my tummy into frenzy."
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,3,"The store offers pastries of different shapes, sizes and tastes for the hungry like myself."
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,4,The area is quite spacious and well lit enough for customers to seek pastries with ease.
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,5,"In short, it's a simple bakery with modest selection of foodstuff for the masses, which is savoury as well."
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,6,"I made my choices of pastry that include few cakes, sweet buns and bread to bring home."
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,7,The staff was pleasant in handling my payment so the service given was okay.
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,8,I began to leave while munching on a scrumptious bun to satisfy my tummy before eating fully at home.
DpAdvEyprMNAEBKWss9h5g,9,Swee Heng Bakery's (Halal) opening hours: 11am - 9pm.
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,0,One of my favorite restaurants in Aeon Bukit Indah.
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,1,"When I get hungry, I mostly run for two things : Local dishes or fast food."
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,2,I rarely went for any Italian cuisine restaurant or others just because I had too.
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,3,It normally depends on my moods or craves.
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,4,":p Anyhow, what I love about this restaurant is its variety types of menu - basically offers every types of rice and mee."
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,5,I crave for them so much when I'm hungry.
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,6,I believe that they satisfy my tummy well instead of other cool or rare meals.
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,7,The ambiance of this restaurant is quite fancy and suitable for families.
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,8,"With variety types of menu, this restaurant totally serves my family well!"
IVteFL41cdoOUbEmlWeOEA,9,The price is affordable too because it values our satisfaction and taste bud.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,0,"Feeling exhausted and hungry after my morning jog, my tummy yearned for something yummy."
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,1,"As I walked past a corner of a mall, my nose picked up an aroma that was so mesmerising till I followed its trail."
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,2,"Upon reaching its origin, my senses kicked in high gear as I encountered the sight before me."
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,3,My eyes captured a staff making hot waffles near a counter in a bakery shop called 'Nom's Bistro'.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,4,"As I approached nearer, my face simply got fixated on the steamy waffles like a salivating dog."
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,5,The staff looked up in surprise as I stared at the succulent pastry that she's making.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,6,She asked for my order with a grin and I yelped my answer for two waffles.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,7,She proceeded to make them while I looked around the place.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,8,The bakery has a sense of chic and professionalism.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,9,Fresh pastry aroma emanated from the back room where bakers were busy baking for the day's sale.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,10,Baker figurines and doughnuts adorn the upper part of the store against a white backdrop for aesthetic reason.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,11,The atmosphere was air-con cool intertwined with the steamy heat emerging from the pastries that came fresh out of the oven.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,12,A sudden whiff of waffle aroma came up to me.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,13,"At that moment, I knew that my order was ready."
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,14,The staff put butter and strawberries on top of the waffles and presented it to me.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,15,I paid her and got ready to gobble the waffles down.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,16,"The butter melted like lava snaking around the waffle and strawberries, which gave a distinct fragrance of dairy and berries."
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,17,I took a bite and a surge of rich flavour gripped me from top to bottom.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,18,I shook it off like a wet dog and ravenously ate the delicious waffles to the last piece.
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,19,"Once done, my body felt energised and my tummy became full."
AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,20,My tiredness slowly dissipated that's replaced with renewed vigour.

AY8Wfn6DSMTkC7t4inV1mg,22,Nom's Bistro opening hours: 8am - 10:30pm.
L9GPnCTTau7fykUEaUvg7g,0,You will be able to spot two type of product when you walk pass the store.
L9GPnCTTau7fykUEaUvg7g,1,They are the pineapple tart and spicy prawn roll.
L9GPnCTTau7fykUEaUvg7g,2,The store gave me the impression that they are very confident in their products since they only sell like mainly these two pastries.
L9GPnCTTau7fykUEaUvg7g,3,The star of the store is the pineapple tarts which has a bunch of loyal customer purchasing even when it is not Chinese New Year.
L9GPnCTTau7fykUEaUvg7g,4,It is also a hot favourite during Chinese New Year.
L9GPnCTTau7fykUEaUvg7g,5,Orders need to be made as early as possible as I heard there are people who are unable to reserve one on the last week before Chinese New Year.
L9GPnCTTau7fykUEaUvg7g,6,"Overall, the pineapple filling is not that sour and biscuit is not overly soft which break at touch."
riAwL4rymwtemYCFf74yEQ,0,"One of a few outlets, Bake Inc is a cheaper alternative to 'branded' bakery outlets such as Four Leaves and BreadTalk for local asian bread."
riAwL4rymwtemYCFf74yEQ,1,"Taste wise however, it can't compare - it just seems to be missing something."
riAwL4rymwtemYCFf74yEQ,2,"Their mexican coffee bun for example isn't as fragrant, and the coffee on top of the bun is piled on too thick."
riAwL4rymwtemYCFf74yEQ,3,The bun itself also doesn't have the buttery goodness that the one at Four Leaves has.
riAwL4rymwtemYCFf74yEQ,4,"They do however offer a few unique choices that I haven't seen elsewhere, such as the 'genie' bun - which is a hot dog bun wrapped in floss and seaweed - it isn't half bad!"
riAwL4rymwtemYCFf74yEQ,5,"Cakes aren't great either, very average."
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,0,Not bad options for pastries.
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,1,"Have come here a few times to get certain select pastries, etc., though, I would think twice about certain specific options."
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,2,Some are really creamy and kinda averagey.
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,3,"What I Love: It's nice to walk by in the morning, and have the smell of fresh baked pastries and cakes welcome you."
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,4,Yummm.
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,5,"They have quite a few options for sandwiches, rolls, bread, cakes, pastries and local delicacies."
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,6,They even have a waffle station - where they do their own fresh waffles - based on what flavors you want.
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,7,Pretty common in certain bakeries all over the nation.
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,8,Pretty reasonable and affordable - in terms of prices.
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,9,"Apart from their sandwiches, have tried their pork sausage bun, pork floss bun and pizza pastry thing."
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,10,Yummmy!
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,11,What I Don't Love: The taste of some stuff can be kinda suspect.
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,12,"So, sample or buy small portions."
mXshURQ0EPwQk5Bhn9dMqA,13,Not a huge fan of their cakes.
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,0,I LOVE THEIR MACARONS!!!
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,1,"Okay, I can't imagine how I haven't written a review yet."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,2,But their macarons are lovely!
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,3,"Granted, I have not made a trip down to Laduree yet, or tasted a TWG macaron lately, but these are pretty good."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,4,$2.50 is also a pretty reasonable price (given that I paid $3 for one at Patisserie G at Millenia Walk..) Having wandered around Pasar Bella today (yay for soft launch of farmers' market!)
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,5,"and seen a plethora of bakeries, I was tempted to procure a sweet treat from one of those many choices."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,6,"One in particular, Bonheur Patisserie, had been so kind as to give me a sample of a mini strawberry macaron."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,7,"However, it was a little on the chewy side and lacking the crisp of a good macaron."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,8,"Hence, I wandered over to my trusty favourite macaron place!"
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,9,"ET Artisan is located along the Grandstand, near the end nearer to Pasar Bella."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,10,There are some really nice relaxing armchairs near the window.
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,11,"Apart from excelling at macarons, the bakery also makes the cutest cakes.."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,12,I love their decor!
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,13,There was a carousel cake in particular that I fell in love with.
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,14,And a sea creature-themed one!
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,15,I've had their yuzu and rose flavours.
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,16,"Yuzu was a nice refreshing citrusy touch, while rose was certainly very strongly rose flavoured (I like it!)"
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,17,and the sweetness was tempered by some raspberry jam in the middle of the buttercream.
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,18,"Crisp on the outside and with a nice bite to the chewy centre, these are clouds of delight!"
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,19,"Just a note of warning: do NOT ever get their cheesecake (I sincerely hope they've taken it off the menu or improved on it), it was really awful and artificial/rubbery-tasting."
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,20,But I forgive them for that sad experience since they produce such awesome macarons.
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,21,:) I want to try all the rest of the flavours!!
_fgpDO0QLoHmmWLjsPf2ZA,22,choc hazelnut and matcha next..
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,0,"This place deserves to be 5 stars because they took my cold, hard, macaroon hating heart and crushed it into a bajillion trillion million gazillion little pieces and sprinkled them into the wind."
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,1,"I am now a lover of many a kind of macaroons but let me tell you, they all stemmed from these little babies right here."
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,2,"Their macaroons are cold, sweet and delicious - just like ice cream."
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,3,I first tried them at a friends place and immediately took down the address and went there the next day to see if they were just as good as they had been the night before.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,4,I even brought along my sister for double confirmation.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,5,Could it be?
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,6,A macaroon we'd actually like?!?!
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,7,My sister was exactly the same as me and we both generally stay away from macaroons (which means a lot because there isn't many sweet things we don't like).
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,8,KABOOM.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,9,ITS AMAZING.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,10,MIND BLOWN.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,11,WHITE FLAG IS IN THE AIR.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,12,We came home we a few boxes that night and marvelled at how delicious they were with our parents.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,13,And from that day onward it became the treats we'd bring into the house whenever we had guests visiting.
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,14,THANK YOU!
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,15,THANK YOU FOR FILLING OUR LIVES WITH YOUR DELICIOUS MACAROONS!
cYgyP3gUCQswFF_crdoqPg,16,We are so grateful.
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,0,How soft and chewy would you want it to be?
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,1,Or would you prefer it to be at different levels of crunchy.
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,2,"Famous Amos can definitely present you a variety of cookies, ranging from soft and chewy to crunchy."
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,3,I actually like it both and it's nice that I get to have the best of both worlds.
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,4,"Since it's just for me, the generic packaging is expected."
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,5,But it's nice to know that they have options for gift giving.
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,6,"So if I'm thinking about giving a cooking as a present, I'd know where to go."
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,7,"But for me, it's all about the aroma."
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,8,It's like Famous Amos is the edible version of an Axe commercial.
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,9,I'll just be walking buy and then poof!
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,10,I'm looking into their glass case display of mounds and mounds of cookies!
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,11,"We may have a cookie monster inside of us, wouldn't you agree?"
40kruop2KvofPNbYdmcbpw,12,"This is definitely a perfect take home gift for your friends, loved ones, and especially kids on a Friday night of after they have done well in their exams."
ij31JX4WDaTUPxTNcTb6Lw,0,"Black carrot cake - nice, plenty of charred bits."
ij31JX4WDaTUPxTNcTb6Lw,1,Could do with a bit more chai poh.
ij31JX4WDaTUPxTNcTb6Lw,2,2 eggs per plate is plenty!
ij31JX4WDaTUPxTNcTb6Lw,3,Could do without the egg shells though.
ij31JX4WDaTUPxTNcTb6Lw,4,Popiah - Unique taste in it.
ij31JX4WDaTUPxTNcTb6Lw,5,Can't place a finger on what it is.
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,0,My friends wanted to come over at my place to watch an important soccer match together on TV.
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,1,"Apart from drinks and snacks galore like chips, fries and cashew nuts already available at my home, I thought of getting some cakes to sweeten the tongue."
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,2,"Hence, I visited a bakery shop named 'Angie The Choice'."
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,3,It offers some selection of delectable cakes that I spotted before.
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,4,The place exhibits a modest setting against a backdrop of pastries arranged on shelves and in glass casings.
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,5,"I pondered upon a display of cakes within a glass casing, which a staff approached me for any assistance."
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,6,"After spending some time thinking, I decided to buy a cheesecake, chocolate cake and pandan cake."
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,7,The staff helped to put them in small boxes to carry out and I made my payments at the counter.
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,8,The service was satisfactory and the choice of available cakes was decent.
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,9,"In summation, it was a worthwhile buying experience, which I don't mind returning for another pastry."
iGTwGPZwS6Va85QHQ7j9QQ,10,Angie The Choice's opening hours: 10am - 9:30pm.
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,0,This is one of my favourite bakeries.
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,1,"There's another bakery with cheaper stuff within the vicinity, but Champion Bread products score more points with my tastebuds."
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,2,"Freshly baked daily, Champion Bread offers an insane spread of bread and sweet buns."
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,3,I used to have their egg mayonnaise and chicken ham bun for breakfast every morning.
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,4,"And if you love cranberries as much as I do, you'll also adore their cranberry loaves and cranberry sugar twists."
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,5,They come with a more generous amount of cranberries than a lot of other bakeries!
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,6,"This branch doesn't offer whole cream cakes, only the rectangular sliced ones."
m2dPdGT1r8aDsj-NnCNMHA,7,Champion Bread has a bigger branch that does sell delicious cream cakes near Bukit Gombak MRT station.
wZvN1GJ6LM090-Tr42sxKg,0,I guess they try to be different by adding curry powder to their white carrot cake.
wZvN1GJ6LM090-Tr42sxKg,1,Their black version is nothing close to the good black versions out there.
wZvN1GJ6LM090-Tr42sxKg,2,It's ok la.
wZvN1GJ6LM090-Tr42sxKg,3,"Different, but if you are looking for a traditional carrot cake fix, look elsewhere."
wZvN1GJ6LM090-Tr42sxKg,4,Sometimes...I think...don't fix what ain't broken.
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,0,I never liked durian products although I take the durian fruit.
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,1,The market has been coming out with real durian meat product that is equivalent to eating the real durian.
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,2,One of them is the Durian Pancake offers by Four Season Durian.
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,3,"Trust me, I didn't expect the pancake to taste like that before I tried."
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,4,The crepe is very crispy and durian meat is cold and delicious.
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,5,Very good combination.
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,6,I won't reject buying it again if there is no queue.
S7FupdT_3u_3H-vHrhe4Tw,7,"I observed customer buying in bulk, like 5, 10 pieces at one go and enjoy the pancake at home in comfort."
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,0,"Bought a $10 earl grey chiffon cake before, it's disappointing."
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,1,The cake wasn't soft and it tastes more of orange than earl grey.
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,2,Decided to give it another chance.
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,3,"This time, we bought a honey brioche and coffee bun."
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,4,The honey brioche is disappointing.
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,5,"When I sliced it in half, I can see flour spots in it."
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,6,It's more obvious in the picture after I toasted it.
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,7,"Hey, c'mon, this is a professional bakery."
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,8,This brioche cost a lot more than other bakeries in Tampines Mall.
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,9,Yet I'm get bread made by amateurs.
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,10,"This is bread, you are supposed to knead the dough, and not cake where you might just fold in the flour resulting in unmixed flour."
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,11,The coffee bun... utter disappointment.
bCrnWI8f-Pg696WjX-cwwQ,12,I would rather not comment further.
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,0,"Having known for the desserts, my friends and I decided to give it a go."
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,1,"Sadly, the food and service at Vivocity was disappointing."
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,2,"Service staffs greeted us when we walked in, but it didn't feel sincere at all."
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,3,"It was not only hard to grab the attention of the staffs to order our food, almost all our first choice on the menu was apparently 'sold out' or 'not available'."
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,4,"We were there for an early dinner, about 5pm, so there shouldn't be an excuse of 'sold out'."
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,5,"If so many items are unavailable, then might as well put a sticker or something on the menu to indicate its availability, instead of customers re-thinking about the next food."
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,6,"I asked for a little spicy for my pasta, and I was given something amounting to a volcano explosion."
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,7,It was nearly impossible to eat.
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,8,It was so spicy even my friends who had higher threshold couldn't take it.
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,9,Ridiculous.
RFa-_q834hdaeKOtUUIC4g,10,"Perhaps its just this outlet, but I'm not going back there again."
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,0,Bakerzin Enjoyed a slow dinner by myself and ordered my usual choice - seafood linguine.
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,1,"The menu said ""with a touch of spice"" so I asked for more spice in mine."
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,2,Food came relatively fast and still piping hot.
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,3,Good!
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,4,Their version has cherry tomatoes in it so there's a sweetness yet tanginess blend.
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,5,Nice.
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,6,Seafood is also fresh so that's good.
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,7,"Unfortunately, my 'spicier' request was not spicy at all!"
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,8,Would have enjoyed it more if it's spicer I reckon.
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,9,All in all a good meal and would return again.
6Sww_6O3dpJWM0Tpi5gVrw,10,:)
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,0,A little squeeze.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,1,Weird smell within the outlet.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,2,"Alas, there are saving graces due to nice desserts."
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,3,I was looking forward to my Bailey's SoufflÃ© but they don't serve it no more.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,4,A little disappointed.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,5,Saw the Mango Passion SoufflÃ© and decided to give it a short.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,6,Not too bad.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,7,The SoufflÃ© was as per their usual standard.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,8,"Fluffy, light and moist inside."
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,9,Except this time is was with mango and passion fruit to taste.
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,10,"As I let my teeth cut through the already soft and fluffy SoufflÃ©, I tasted the sugar bits and it gives it more body."
122pjwAU1kGmSJDuvkTr5g,11,I should come back for this again when my sweet tooth beckons.
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,0,"Looking for some snacks to bring home, I stumbled upon a bakery shop called 'Ecreative' that sells an assortment of pastries."
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,1,The aroma of cakes filled its ambience till it drew me to its shelves of delightful goodies.
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,2,"It's a simple bakery shop no less, which is typical of those commonly found elsewhere."
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,3,"Nevertheless, what differs from one another is the choice of pastries offered."
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,4,The aroma emanating from the food represents its distinct flavour that entices customers like myself to savour it.
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,5,"In reaction, I took a tray and pincers in order to select some pastries."
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,6,"I chose a couple of buns that contained fillings of tuna, custard, vanilla cream topped with chocolate rice, sweetened butter and other food flavours."
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,7,"Once done, I paid for them at the counter before they're being stuffed into bags for me to bring back."
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,8,The pastries were delicious and the service given was okay.
16QXGOpaRQTHTOFg8PPBBw,9,Ecreative's opening hours: 11am - 9pm.
KvRnVURiSBr2-Zuvzv-y1w,0,Awfully Chocolate is famous for their chocolate cakes.
KvRnVURiSBr2-Zuvzv-y1w,1,My favourite has got to be their Chocolate Banana cake.
KvRnVURiSBr2-Zuvzv-y1w,2,I also like to take away their Hei Ice Cream which is great for a lonely night with a good book or a movie.
KvRnVURiSBr2-Zuvzv-y1w,3,I also tried their Cold Poached Chocolate which basically tastes like chocolate mousse with flavoured alcoholic whipped cream served on top.
KvRnVURiSBr2-Zuvzv-y1w,4,Their dark chocolate truffles may be a little expensive (since I paid $2 for ONE piece once) but the quality of the chocolate justifies the price.
KvRnVURiSBr2-Zuvzv-y1w,5,"Definitely a must try place for chocolate lovers, the only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because their stores often lack enough seats so it's quite depressing to always go and find a spot to sit down and savour their chocolate."
jiwlDySoGVnfj5psdkSNbg,0,I wish I didn't have to remove a star as I do want to like this place.
jiwlDySoGVnfj5psdkSNbg,1,"My earlier 4 star review on the food still stands, but is averaged down to 3 stars because of 2 star service: Cedele needs more wait staff who don't act like clueless high school part timers."
jiwlDySoGVnfj5psdkSNbg,2,"And despite a fair number of staff standing around, it was difficult to get their attention to take our orders."
jiwlDySoGVnfj5psdkSNbg,3,"It's almost like they're trying to avoid eye contact without looking like they're doing it on purpose; and even after being asked multiple times, our waters did not get refilled."
jiwlDySoGVnfj5psdkSNbg,4,Tables were left empty for too long even with a growing queue of customers waiting to be seated.
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,0,Never been a fan of Breadtalk and their overly fancy and overly priced breads.
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,1,I also blame them for infecting the bread industry as even local neighbourhood bakeries jumped on the Breadtalk styled bandwagon.
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,2,"So when I came across Baker Talent, I was initially skeptical and put off by the ridiculously long queues."
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,3,"Yet, we should never slam anything unless we tried it, so one fine day when the queue wasnt too bad, I decided to give it a try."
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,4,Impressed is what I can say.
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,5,They do not bombard you with too many different varieties or overly complicated bake choices.
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,6,"Instead, you have a few basic flavours that are all very very good."
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,7,"Cranberry Cheese, Mushroom, Pineapple or Chocolate Bolo buns, etc."
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,8,Simple good flavours at very very reasonable prices.
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,9,Nothing is over $1.
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,10,"Goes to show, you can still offer simple yet delicious food at reasonable prices."
syILyMC4LYgSoaKcAPTFAg,11,Something some of the bigger food companies seem to have forgotten.
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,0,"There's always a bit of a queue here, but that's probably because they take an extremely long time to make just one bubble tea."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,1,"Besides the array of baked goods, which I hear from friends are quite good, I go there occasionally for the bubble tea, and mainly because it's conveniently located next to Foodfare, where you might be for lunch."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,2,"It's good bubble tea, but it's hardly worth the wait."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,3,"Imagine having to wait 10 minutes, when you're the only person waiting for bubble tea, and there are 3 people making it."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,4,"The service isn't great either, so I'm unsure why there are always lots of people here."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,5,"The pastries must be really good, so I guess you should try them, though they're usually filled with custard, cream or other really unhealthy things."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,6,"If you really must, go for the fruit based bubble teas."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,7,"Lychee, peach and passionfruit are amongst the best they have."
69opMjdEfTIenbCocPQt3w,8,"Basically, meh."
uWpeDZD2wDFmuDfoFY1KWQ,0,"I've stayed in Choa Chu Kang for more than 7 years now, and this shop space has changed hands at least once a year."
uWpeDZD2wDFmuDfoFY1KWQ,1,"Baker Talent has been here for quite awhile now, and there is always a queue, no matter the time of day."
uWpeDZD2wDFmuDfoFY1KWQ,2,"I used to think it was popular for their bubble teas, but after trying one that was average I realised it was the buns that were luring the crowd."
uWpeDZD2wDFmuDfoFY1KWQ,3,I decided to try their custard and butter ones.
uWpeDZD2wDFmuDfoFY1KWQ,4,"Both actually tasted good, but not good enough that I would jump in line every time I walk past."
uWpeDZD2wDFmuDfoFY1KWQ,5,"The buns are quite cheap, often below $1."
uWpeDZD2wDFmuDfoFY1KWQ,6,"The staff is friendly earlier in the day, and not so when they are tired or busy."
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,0,"For most people, when it comes to egg tarts, its the HK style dim sum ones or Portugese style ones that comes to mind."
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,1,"Yet, a local shop decided to give it a delightful Singapore twist."
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,2,The result are cuter and colorful tarts with 16 different flavors.
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,3,"Their main shop is located in Lorong Kilat just off Jalan Jurong Kechil, fast becoming another foodie enclave like Holland V. I must admit when I first came across them I wasnt too impressed, after all I'm not really an egg tart fan."
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,4,Maybe its because its smaller.
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,5,Maybe its because the pastry is thinner.
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,6,But I think its probably because there's a lot more filling compared to pastry.
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,7,I find the fruit flavors ones which are popular a bit icky but thats just me.
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,8,"I prefer the cheese, mushroom and chicken ones which taste like mini quiches."
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,9,Not bad at all.
BzVakTrfqksEmgvV_M0VmQ,10,"They also have kiosks in IMM, City Square Mall, Marine Parade and NEX."
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,0,Located near the first floor car park entrance is this bustling Crystal Jade My Bread bakery.
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,1,"Famous for their dim sum, Crystal Jade's bakery is also no less famous."
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,2,The staff here all speak Cantonese and are very polite and pretty much encourage you get as many buns as possible after 8pm when their Point-of-Sale (POS) Systems automatically give you a 20% discount.
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,3,The staff will be able to tell you how much each item costs after the discount.
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,4,I love their char siew polo buns.
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,5,"It is sweet on the outside, but fluffy AND NOT DRY on the inside.I also absolutely love egg white egg tarts."
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,6,Alot more milky and creamier than the normal egg tarts I feel.
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,7,I've been an absolute fan of the cupcakes for years.
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,8,"I put them in the fridge overnight and the next morning, they taste just like Sara Lee Pound cakes you get from the supermarket."
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,9,"Of course, with a hard chocolately top layer!"
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,10,My parents love the wife biscuits (lau po bing) and they are usually packed in boxes of 3.
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,11,Although you can ask the shop staff to get you individual ones too!
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,12,"At just 96cents after the 20% discount, it's cheap!"
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,13,"All in all, my favourite bakery that sells all our favourite cantonese breakfast goodies that are still fresh even at 8pm!"
fWKG9IQCnAkZoPIu0HBtUg,14,I've seen them pull out new trays of egg tarts from their oven at 8pm!
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,0,"Based on the two pastries I purchased here, it was a measly 2-stars."
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,1,This location is in the food court floor in the Raffles shopping mall.
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,2,"In the early morning hours, it was busy with business people looking for their breakfast fix before heading out to work."
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,3,I bought one savory pastry which contained chicken and mushroom.
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,4,"It sure looked good based on appearances, but it was chewy, stale, and bland."
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,5,"The other one was a little better, as there were tater tots baked into this piece of bread, then covered with nacho cheese and green onions."
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,6,"Again, chewy and stale."
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,7,"Perhaps I'm spoiled by the constant turnover and freshness of the ""fresh bread"" from 85C, but there was no soul to this bread and pastry chain."
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,8,"Breadtalk started in Singapore, but now has locations all over Southeast Asia."
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,9,I suspect they put out unsold bread the next day.
zdQyKZcvwhui5eZSUp-anA,10,"At any rate, check out Breadtalk only if you have no other alternative."
emLmgU4MXeMOoyJzvDxQXA,0,"This stall sells biscuits of varying shapes and sizes, many of which you would recognise if you were a child or teenager in the 1980s and 1990s."
emLmgU4MXeMOoyJzvDxQXA,1,"Biscuits are stored in metal cans, stacked one on top another and displayed around the outside of the stall."
emLmgU4MXeMOoyJzvDxQXA,2,"Apart from offering you a chance to revisit the past and indulge in some nostalgia, the stall sells a variety of market produce."
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,0,I was walking around Tamp 1 one day and something told me to head inside this bakery.
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,1,The first thing I saw - gorgeous little mochi cheese buns.
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,2,I knew i had to get a couple...or maybe 20.
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,3,"I probably looked like a burglar, grabbing bun after bun and stacking them on my tray."
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,4,I suppose there were many pairs of eyes wondering whether this boy was going to eat all 20 mochi cheese buns.
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,5,"WELL, YES."
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,6,But not in one go of course.
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,7,Made for a good afternoon snack the day after.
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,8,Yeah...didnt last me till the day after that.
sIPb4dcxpuQNIfCwIOKHgQ,9,Hmmmm.
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,0,Yamazaki bread was my favorite.
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,1,"Yeah, you spotted that, it's a past tense."
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,2,"The bread here is tasty, has a nice and soft texture, and is quite affordable."
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,3,"But ever since another bakery at the same level opened, I kinda switched sides."
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,4,I feel that the cakes and puffs here are really disappointing.
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,5,"They looked so awesome on display, so I actually bought whole cake and the cream puffs."
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,6,"But when you actually eat it, you'll be so disillusioned."
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,7,"For the puff, the cream is just a tad too much, and doesn't go very well with the puff."
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,8,"For the cake, the strawberries are too sour and overall taste bland."
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,9,Whoever said 'looks are deceiving' is so right.
v_peLyCt7NX6PpXSGgVxuQ,10,"Okay well, with all that said, this is still the place to be if you would want to get the mini breads."
ENb1ylDF2Y8S1x_z8T9uVQ,0,The kues here are decent - its good that its giving Bengawan Solo who otherwise pretty much monopolises the retail kue scene in Singapore a competitor!
ENb1ylDF2Y8S1x_z8T9uVQ,1,My favourite kue here is the 'Onde-Onde'.
ENb1ylDF2Y8S1x_z8T9uVQ,2,"Orange in colour rather than green which most of us are used to, their Onde-Onde is soft and chewy with silky liquid gula melakka that gushes out when you bite into it."
ENb1ylDF2Y8S1x_z8T9uVQ,3,"Their pandan cake loses Bengawan Solo's by far though, very sweet and I couldn't taste enough of the pandan flavour."
