bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,0,Let's just say I enjoy egg tarts a lot from the Hong Kong chain to write another review.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,1,The restaurant in Singapore opened since May 5th and there have been people queuing up for a highly anticipated try out.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,2,The seating is limited so constant queuing is there.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,3,As the staff doesn't make it quicker while they take their time to clean and serve.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,4,I've never seen a single cafe restaurant in Hong Kong with people queuing while empty tables are available for seating.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,5,The management of this establishment must be staging the overwhelming customers for up selling their cafe.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,6,"I've gone up to the staff asking why aren't customers being seated while there are empty tables, they can only replied by walking away in silence."
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,7,"Total waiting time, 50 minutes to get seated!"
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,8,"On with the food, unfortunately, practically everything on the menu was sold out by 4pm!"
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,9,This is a first for me for a HK cafe.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,10,The milk tea is authentic and the lemon tea is quite true to the original except it was already sweetened.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,11,"Since most items were sold out but egg tarts, I will review what I can, egg tarts."
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,12,"Again, there was a waiting time."
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,13,"I ordered what I can, limited three per customer."
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,14,I've ordered 6 and it was a complete disappointment!
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,15,The color of the custard is pale white instead of the rich yellow color and the texture breaks instantaneously as if too much water mixture was used.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,16,The crust int flakey and it's unappetizing.
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,17,"And the taste, it isn't HK for sure!"
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,18,Over all experience a huge disappointment!
bux6sb7bKY9IiCQZvlL3eQ,19,Will not return for sure!
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,0,Excellent brunch spot if you have kids.
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,1,"There's a bouncy castle, mini sports and a pretty big field for your kids to play while you enjoy ""adult"" time."
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,2,Not sure if I would come here though if not for the family atmosphere.
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,3,The coffee barista is usually in the weeds so we finish our meal before a drop of caffeine has graced our table.
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,4,The food is okay but it feels like the eggs Benedict needs a little more depth.
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,5,Maybe add an avocado or some more hollandaise.
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,6,Pretty basic fare and ordering from the tablet under the table removes any chance of a mistake from a server.
fqm9inWMvEj6PfviEavMpQ,7,Worth giving a try if you're in the area.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,0,This is a small Japanese restaurant inside a shopping mall near the Holiday Inn on Killiney and Orchard.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,1,The place have only few tables where you can share a table with others if available.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,2,"The main focus of the menu leans toward Ramin and other soups, but still they offer some other items as well."
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,3,"The service was to point, friendly and fast."
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,4,The food was plenty and delicious.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,5,Prices were very reasonable considering your are at a higher end of the city.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,6,"The food as I mentioned was fresh, hot and delicious."
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,7,I just wish they do not use as much MSG as they do (in general in SG).
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,8,"Miso Ramin+++This was huge portions with two slices of pork that was so tender and so tasty, corn, green onions and bean sprouts."
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,9,S$13 Chicken Kar age+++Crispy fried chicken pieces served with sauce.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,10,S$6 Age Gyoza+++Deep fried Gyoza filled with pork.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,11,It was OK.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,12,I noticed everyone else eating the pan fried Gyoza and that is we we should have ordered.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,13,"S$5 Fried Rice+++It was good, mixed vegetables, eggs stir fried."
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,14,This really a nice spot to have some delicious Ramin.
7pkN5O3rJ4JFcxWXY8uGlw,15,They are open until 12 midnight.
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,0,"I was taken here for dinner on a Monday night, and we got here before 7pm so there wasn't a queue."
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,1,"There is a promotion where you get 3 rolls for the price of 2, and my companion, by some oversight, ordered the prawn, soft shell crab, and salmon rolls, which all happened to be aburi-ed."
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,2,"I loved the rolls, but three aburi-ed rolls which sort of taste the same after a while, for 2 people, are a bit much, and hence we struggled to finish the rolls, which resulted in a fair bit of waste."
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,3,"We also got the normal chirashi, a portion of salmon sashimi, a pitan tofu."
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,4,"The chirashi was topped with thickly sliced fish of various varieties, and the rice was sufficiently vinegared."
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,5,Yum!
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,6,My favorite was the pitan tofu.
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,7,"Tofu is actually a misnomer as they use egg custard as the tofu, and then top it with century eggs, flying fish roe, spring onions, and shredded surimi."
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,8,I really liked this.
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,9,Prices here are very reasonable for what they are.
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,10,"I guess this is the Singapore version of hole-in-the-wall sushi, tucked in a corner of Orchard Road."
I-VLRZVD2mpZW_mnaho3bQ,11,"They should probably have a sake shot promo, just to value-add."
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,0,"I was walking along Sago Street one afternoon pretending to be a tourist when I saw a local aunty in front of me pointing to the pastry stall on the right, telling her caucasian friends that this is her favourite chinese pastry shop."
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,1,I had never tried it but it looked pretty good.
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,2,"From the shop front, you can see bakers in the back of the shop rolling out fresh batches of buns and pastries."
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,3,"Taking the aunty's word for it, I bought a couple of Bo Lo Buns as it appeared to be their specialty."
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,4,I tried the custard bo lo bun and the roasted chicken bo lo bun.
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,5,The custard bun was great!
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,6,"The flavour of the bun was well balanced, a little sweet and salty, and a nice eggy custard filled the middle."
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,7,It all went down really nicely but the bun could have been a little softer.
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,8,The roasted chicken bo lo bun did not really appeal to my taste buds.
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,9,Perhaps it is because I'm too used to having char siew in my bo lo bun that having roasted chicken in it felt like a substandard substitute.
srv-bqtZOwkoFk3M0n6gxQ,10,"Overall, the buns were alright, not necessarily the best in town but decent enough for a snack while walking around chinatown."
