      "Cluster: 1 We had the Napolitana pizza this time and the tomato base was really good.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 The maple syrup is light and sweet with a tang of caramel(?)\n",
      "Cluster: 0 and an excellent addition to the crispy pancakes or waffles.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 Crisp exterior with a fluffy interior with more banana and walnuts within, coupled with their gorgeous maple syrup-butter sauce... One vessel of sauce is not enough for 3 large pancakes, so I got another.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 It cost me $2 but oh well, I didn't come to Clinton St Baking Co. to be a stingy person.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 A friend told me you can change the flavor of one of the pancakes for an extra $2, if I am not wrong.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I also got the cheese grits, and ye, it tastes like a savory oatmeal with cheese.\n",
      "Cluster: 3 Very regular.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 Service was prompt, but I guess a true test of the waitstaff is peak hours, which I obviously did not get to see.\n",

      "Cluster: 1 Unfortunately it was after a visit to Katz (and if you've seen the size of their pastrami sandwiches you'd know how stuffed I was at that time) so all I had was the bacon and it didn't leave much of an impression then.\n",

      "Cluster: 1 By the time it was our turn to be seated it was 2 hours.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Be warned that the queue is deceptively short because everyone just gives their handphone number and goes away while waiting.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 These were nice and fluffy and thick yet light.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 I think the only other place in Singapore that comes close so far is Skyve.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 If you put the pancakes from those 2 places together and made me choose 1, I don't know which would win.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 But maybe Clinton Street because of that wonderful maple syrup/butter mix, which married the taste of maple syrup with the smoothness of melted butter.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Come here!\n",
      "Cluster: 2 Unless you're a yummy mummy with a baby trying to cut the queue -_-\"\n",
      "Cluster: 0 A great spot for a classic American breakfast.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 Hopefully that will improve with time.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Definitely order the chicken and waffles.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Staff recommended to order onion rings as sides.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Do not order onion rings.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Completely disappointing.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 We came on a Monday afternoon, not too busy just some tables of ladies of leisure... but be aware your last order is at 5pm.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I have finally eaten here!\n",
      "Cluster: 2 I have tried on numerous occasions and left my number, however by the time I am called, it is much later and I am already eating elsewhere.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 This place is popular!\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I came on a Saturday in the late afternoon and my dining partner already had a table.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 It was raining outside, so it was quiet.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 When I crossed the one road I needed to get to the outlet, I was benched and looked and felt like I had been given a wash down in the shower!\n",
      "Cluster: 1 As I entered, I was given paper towels to help me dry off which I really appreciated - great service!\n",
      "Cluster: 4 So... the food.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Massive portions which is always a good thing.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 You will not go hungry!\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I ordered the chorizo sausage and scrambled eggs.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 They were light and fluffy and the chorizo had a little spice; I really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Price wise, it seems a bit on the expensive side, but the portions make up for it for sure.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 We also had waffles and chicken.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Waffles were to be expected however the chicken was none of your deep fried KFC style stuff, but hand breadcrumbed, quality meat - tasty!\n",
      "Cluster: 2 Worth trying.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I didn't have the famous pancakes, but will be back.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 They looked huge, light, fluffy and tasty.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 Coffee was pretty ok, not to shout about, but a decent cup.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 Next time I will try the divine looking pecan pie; I could not manage to eat another thing this trip.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 I can't think of a better place to have pies, waffles or pancakes in Singapore.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 The diner style atmosphere is casual and relaxed.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 A great place to bring kids and family to during weekends.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 To summarize it all in a word, pancakes.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 EAT the pancakes.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Clinton St Baking Co. of Manhattan's Lower East Side finally lands in Singapore with a huge splash, with glowing reviews in the island's English language broadsheet, and features on TV.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Stepping inside, the dining room successfully recreates that typical American diner feel, similar to the original in NY (but definitely much newer).\n",
      "Cluster: 0 The entrees were decently good, but I'd recommend the pancakes above everything else.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside, paired with a sinful maple-butter sauce that's just amazing as it is calorific.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Blueberry, banana walnut or chocolate chunk, they're all good.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 The house brew is drip coffee, and refills are free!\n",
      "Cluster: 4 They had a couple of Southern offerings on the menu, but IMO they were Northern interpretations of Southern food.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I liked that the buttermilk fried chicken had cornmeal in the batter, however the batter lost its crunchiness rather quickly and fell off the chicken before you had a chance to bite it.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Conclusion, stick to the pancakes.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 They don't take reservations, and weekend brunch lines are an hour wait or more.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 To avoid the crowds, I recommend coming in on a weekday, or late in the afternoon on a weekend, or heading for the pastry & coffee takeout counter instead.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 It's been a while since I was back in Manhattan, and I personally have not been to the original on Clinton St (there, I heard the lines are an hour long too), but comparing this to other brunch type places in Singapore they pretty much come out tops.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 3 if this is a place in the US, 4 cos it's in Singapore.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 My first time here.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Ever.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Didn't know about the New York branch so there is no basis for comparison.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I've heard lots of excited rumblings of course, and friends who used to live in New York were thrilled about its opening.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Fair enough.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 From all accounts, I hear that this place largely works.\n",
      "Cluster: 4 The food is comparable and all.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I'll have to take their word for it.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I only came here for some cake and I got the upside down pineapple cake.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I don't know why but seeing a badly sliced and sloppily presented cake annoyed me.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 It shows a lack of care in the attentive-level of staff.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 When I went to pay, I noticed that other cakes (of other flavors) were similarly badly sliced.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Woah.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 I really did think Clinton St Bakery was better than this.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 Taste-wise, the cake was fine.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Not great, not terrible.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 The staff was sufficiently polite.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 But I think the devil's in the details and they need to teach their staff how to slice cakes properly, lift the slices and place them on plates.\n",
      "Cluster: 3 Having been to their original location in LES multiple times, I was very impressed with the pancakes at their new establishment in Singapore.\n",
      "Cluster: 5 (Let's be honest here, most of the restaurants that have opened up branches in Singapore are disappointments compared to their original location overseas.\n",
