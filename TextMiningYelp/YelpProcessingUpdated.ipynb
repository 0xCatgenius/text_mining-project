      "Cluster: 0 It's like wobbly and could quite easily just break apart if you don't hold it right.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 The custard is good though!\n",

      "Cluster: 0 Have it cool and the shape holds better but it also means it is slightly firmer.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 It is sweet but not overly so it does make a good tea time (or any time) snack.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 It is a nice treat to have once in a while.\n",
      "Cluster: 3 Located near Maxwell Food Centre and in the vicinity of Chinatown, you find this shop opposite a Taoist Temple along South Bridge Road.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I usually recommend this confectionary shop to my foreign friends as they sell decent egg tarts and other pastries.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 Good for our taste bug, but bad for our stomach!\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Eat the egg tarts warm as you get the best out of this delicious snack, the others are average - nothing to shout about but it's worth giving them a try.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I would recommend buying a few and head elsewhere to enjoy it.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Like Carolyn - the other reviewer had mentioned, the coffee is mediocre.\n",
      "Cluster: 3 So if you are nearby Maxwell Food Centre or Chinatown, remember to head down!\n",

      "Cluster: 2 I didn't get a chance to sit down at Tong Heng's to have them fresh, but trust me, heat them up a little when you get home and I can bet they're as good as they are fresh.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 If not, then I'm really missing out.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 The egg tarts are lightly sweet and just egg-y enough and the pastry is a little different being crumbly rather than flaky.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 And I love it.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 The char siew pastry puffs are just as good, in my opinion, sweet and flaky, but with the right amount of savory to do the char siew justice.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 So it's whatever you're in the mood for.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Or have them both!\n",
      "Cluster: 2 Service/ Ive seen comments on good service but maybe it was an off day but they were not very welcoming/nice Food/ egg tart and moon cake was good.\n",

      "Cluster: 1 Price/ $1.70/egg tart Diamond shaped egg tarts was a first.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 I feel like the ratio of crust to egg was different.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Because it's a seemingly pretty popular place it seemed like their egg tarts had a decent turn over so getting fresh warmer ones may be the norm.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 The custard is not too thick and it is silky which is nice.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I tried the normal one not the coconut.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 The moon cake with lotus paste was also good.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Not overly wow-ed by the place.\n",

      "Cluster: 1 tinyurl.com/8jlfe44 The last plate was some very tasty duck.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 tinyurl.com/8rbtep3 I also had a local dessert that seemed kind of like a custard with a mollases like sauce.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 You get to try the various Singapore ethnic cuisines in one area - Peranakan (Straits Chinese), Chinese, Malay and Indian.\n",
      "Cluster: 3 The Indian food is always the favorite as the dishes are well executed.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 Lychee or mango sorbet.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I like the Horlicks ice cream which is creamy and malty.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 The not so good thing about a local food buffet is that you cannot really try everything as almost all the dishes are very rich with coconut and carb-based (rice and noodles).\n",

      "Cluster: 0 If you put the pancakes from those 2 places together and made me choose 1, I don't know which would win.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 But maybe Clinton Street because of that wonderful maple syrup/butter mix, which married the taste of maple syrup with the smoothness of melted butter.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 We also had waffles and chicken.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 Waffles were to be expected however the chicken was none of your deep fried KFC style stuff, but hand breadcrumbed, quality meat - tasty!\n",

      "Cluster: 0 Stepping inside, the dining room successfully recreates that typical American diner feel, similar to the original in NY (but definitely much newer).\n",
      "Cluster: 2 The entrees were decently good, but I'd recommend the pancakes above everything else.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside, paired with a sinful maple-butter sauce that's just amazing as it is calorific.\n",
      "Cluster: 2 Blueberry, banana walnut or chocolate chunk, they're all good.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 The house brew is drip coffee, and refills are free!\n",
      "Cluster: 3 They had a couple of Southern offerings on the menu, but IMO they were Northern interpretations of Southern food.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 I liked that the buttermilk fried chicken had cornmeal in the batter, however the batter lost its crunchiness rather quickly and fell off the chicken before you had a chance to bite it.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 Conclusion, stick to the pancakes.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 They don't take reservations, and weekend brunch lines are an hour wait or more.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 To avoid the crowds, I recommend coming in on a weekday, or late in the afternoon on a weekend, or heading for the pastry & coffee takeout counter instead.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 It's been a while since I was back in Manhattan, and I personally have not been to the original on Clinton St (there, I heard the lines are an hour long too), but comparing this to other brunch type places in Singapore they pretty much come out tops.\n",

      "Cluster: 0 Not great, not terrible.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 The staff was sufficiently polite.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 But I think the devil's in the details and they need to teach their staff how to slice cakes properly, lift the slices and place them on plates.\n",
      "Cluster: 1 Having been to their original location in LES multiple times, I was very impressed with the pancakes at their new establishment in Singapore.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 (Let's be honest here, most of the restaurants that have opened up branches in Singapore are disappointments compared to their original location overseas.\n",
      "Cluster: 0 E.g., Lady M, Din Tai Fung, Tim Ho Wan, Lawrys, etc.)\n",
      "Cluster: 1 We came for lunch on a weekday, around 11:40, so there was no wait.\n",
